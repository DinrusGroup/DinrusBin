        IBitBucket implements a simple mechanism to store and recover a 
        large quantity of data for the duration of the hosting process.
        It is intended to act as a local-cache for a remote data-source, 
        or as a spillover area for large in-memory cache instances. 
        
        Note that any and all stored data is rendered invalid the moment
        an IBucket object is garbage-collected.

        All index keys must be unique. Writing to an IBitBucket with an
        existing key will overwrite any previous content.
