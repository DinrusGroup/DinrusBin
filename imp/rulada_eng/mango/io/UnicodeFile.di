        Read and write unicode files

        For our purposes, unicode files are an encoding of textual material.
        The goal of this module is to interface that external-encoding with
        a programmer-defined internal-encoding. This internal encoding is
        declared via the template argument T, whilst the external encoding
        is either specified or derived.

        Three internal encodings are supported: char, wchar, and dchar. The
        methods herein operate upon arrays of this type. For example, read()
        returns an array of the type, whilst write() and append() expect an
        array of said type.

        Supported external encodings are as follow (from Unicode.d):

                Unicode.Unknown 
                Unicode.UTF_8
                Unicode.UTF_8N
                Unicode.UTF_16
                Unicode.UTF_16BE
                Unicode.UTF_16LE 
                Unicode.UTF_32 
                Unicode.UTF_32BE
                Unicode.UTF_32LE 

        These can be divided into non-explicit and explicit encodings:

                Unicode.Unknown 
                Unicode.UTF_8
                Unicode.UTF_16
                Unicode.UTF_32 


                Unicode.UTF_8N
                Unicode.UTF_16BE
                Unicode.UTF_16LE 
                Unicode.UTF_32BE
                Unicode.UTF_32LE 
        
        The former group of non-explicit encodings may be used to 'discover'
        an unknown encoding, by examining the first few bytes of the file
        content for a signature. This signature is optional for all files, 
        but is often written such that the content is self-describing. When
        the encoding is unknown, using one of the non-explicit encodings will
        cause the read() method to look for a signature and adjust itself 
        accordingly. It is possible that a ZWNBSP character might be confused 
        with the signature; today's files are supposed to use the WORD-JOINER 
        character instead.
       
        The group of explicit encodings are for use when the file encoding is
        known. These *must* be used when writing or appending, since written
        content must be in a known format. It should be noted that, during a
        read operation, the presence of a signature is in conflict with these 
        explicit varieties.

        Method read() returns the current content of the file, whilst write()
        sets the file content, and file length, to the provided array. Method
        append() adds content to the tail of the file. When appending, it is
        your responsibility to ensure the existing and current encodings are
        correctly matched.

        Methods to inspect the file system, check the status of a file or
        directory, and other facilities are made available via the FileProxy
        superclass.
