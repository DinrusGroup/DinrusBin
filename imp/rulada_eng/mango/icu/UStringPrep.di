        StringPrep API implements the StingPrep framework as described 
        by RFC 3454.

        StringPrep prepares Unicode strings for use in network protocols. 
        Profiles of StingPrep are set of rules and data according to with 
        the Unicode Strings are prepared. Each profiles contains tables 
        which describe how a code point should be treated. The tables are 
        broadly classied into

        - Unassinged Table: Contains code points that are unassigned 
          in the Unicode Version supported by StringPrep. Currently 
          RFC 3454 supports Unicode 3.2.

        - Prohibited Table: Contains code points that are prohibted 
          from the output of the StringPrep processing function.

        - Mapping Table: Contains code ponts that are deleted from the 
          output or case mapped.

        The procedure for preparing Unicode strings:

        1. Map: For each character in the input, check if it has a mapping 
           and, if so, replace it with its mapping.

        2. Normalize: Possibly normalize the result of step 1 using Unicode 
           normalization.

        3. Prohibit: Check for any characters that are not allowed in the 
           output. If any are found, return an error.

        4. Check bidi: Possibly check for right-to-left characters, and if 
           any are found, make sure that the whole string satisfies the 
           requirements for bidirectional strings. If the string does not 
           satisfy the requirements for bidirectional strings, return an 
           error.
