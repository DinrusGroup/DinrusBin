         * number may (or may not) be greater than zero even if more()

         * warranted. However, it is not necessarily a foolproof indication.
         * <P>
         * You can also use it to pack enumerations into arrays. For example:

         * Object arr[] = new Object[e.numberOfRemainingElement()]

         * See_Also: tango.util.collection.iterator.ArrayIterator.ArrayIterator
         * Returns: the number of untraversed elements
