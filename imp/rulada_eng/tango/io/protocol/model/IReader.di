        IReader interface. Each reader operates upon an IBuffer, which is
        provided at construction time. Readers are simple converters of data,
        and have reasonably rigid rules regarding data format. For example,
        each request for data expects the content to be available; an exception
        is thrown where this is not the case. If the data is arranged in a more
        relaxed fashion, consider using IBuffer directly instead.

        All readers support the full set of native data types, plus a full
        selection of array types. The latter can be configured to produce
        either a copy (.dup) of the buffer content, or a slice. See classes
        HeapCopy, BufferSlice and HeapSlice for more on this topic. Applications
        can disable memory management by configuring a Reader with one of the
        binary oriented protocols, and ensuring the optional protocol 'prefix'
        is disabled.

        Readers support Java-esque get() notation. However, the Tango
        style is to place IO elements within their own parenthesis, like
        so:
        
        ---
        int count;
        char[] verse;
        
        read (verse) (count);
        ---

        Note that each element read is distict; this style is affectionately
        known as "whisper". The code below illustrates basic operation upon a
        memory buffer:
        
        ---
        auto buf = new Buffer (256);

        // map same buffer into both reader and writer
        auto read = new Reader (buf);
        auto write = new Writer (buf);

        int i = 10;
        long j = 20;
        double d = 3.14159;
        char[] c = "fred";

        // write data using whisper syntax
        write (c) (i) (j) (d);

        // read them back again
        read (c) (i) (j) (d);


        // same thing again, but using put() syntax instead
        write.put(c).put(i).put(j).put(d);
        read.get(c).get(i).get(j).get(d);
        ---

        Note that certain protocols, such as the basic binary implementation, 
        expect to retrieve the number of array elements from the source. For
        example: when reading an array from a file, the number of elements 
        is read from the file also, and the configurable memory-manager is
        invoked to provide the array space. If content is not arranged in
        such a manner you may read array content directly either by creating
        a Reader with a protocol configured to sidestep array-prefixing, or
        by accessing buffer content directly (via the methods exposed there)
        e.g.

        ---
        void[10] data;
                
        reader.buffer.fill (data);
        ---

        Readers may also be used with any class implementing the IReadable
        interface, along with any struct implementing an equivalent method

                Get the allocator to use for array management. Arrays are
                generally allocated by the IReader, via configured managers.
                A number of Allocator classes are available to manage memory
                when reading array content. Alternatively, the application
                may obtain responsibility for allocation by selecting one of
                the NativeProtocol deriviatives and setting 'prefix' to be
                false. The latter disables internal array management.

                Gaining access to the allocator can expose some additional
                controls. For example, some allocators benefit from a reset
                operation after each data 'record' has been processed.

                By default, an IReader will allocate each array from the 
                heap. You can change that by constructing the Reader
                with an Allocator of choice. For instance, there is a
                BufferSlice which will slice an array directly from
                the buffer where possible. Also available is the record-
                oriented HeaoSlice, which slices memory from within
                a pre-allocated heap area, and should be reset by the client
                code after each record has been read (to avoid unnecessary
                growth).
