// There are 2 types of mutexes: normal mutexes and recursive ones. The attempt

// situation always succeeds and it must be unlocked as many times as it has
// been locked.
//
// However recursive mutexes have several important drawbacks: first, in the
// POSIX implementation, they're less efficient. Second, and more importantly,
// they CAN NOT BE USED WITH CONDITION VARIABLES under Unix! Using them with
// wxCondition will work under Windows and some Unices (notably Linux) but will
// deadlock under other Unix versions (e.g. Solaris). As it might be difficult
// to ensure that a recursive mutex is not used with wxCondition, it is a good
// idea to avoid using recursive mutexes at all. Also, the last problem with
// them is that some (older) Unix versions don't support this at all -- which
// results in a configure warning when building and a deadlock when using them.
