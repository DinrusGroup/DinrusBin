/**
 * Description
 * Sometimes you wish to asynchronously fork out the execution of work and
 * continue working in your own thread. If that will happen often, the
 * overhead of starting and destroying a thread each time might be too
 * high. In such cases reusing already started threads seems like a good
 * idea. And it indeed is, but implementing this can be tedious and
 * error-prone.
 * Therefore GLib provides thread pools for your convenience. An added
 * advantage is, that the threads can be shared between the different
 * subsystems of your program, when they are using GLib.
 * To create a new thread pool, you use g_thread_pool_new(). It is
 * destroyed by g_thread_pool_free().
 * If you want to execute a certain task within a thread pool, you call
 * g_thread_pool_push().
 * To get the current number of running threads you call
 * g_thread_pool_get_num_threads(). To get the number of still
 * unprocessed tasks you call g_thread_pool_unprocessed(). To control the
 * maximal number of threads for a thread pool, you use
 * g_thread_pool_get_max_threads() and g_thread_pool_set_max_threads().
 * Finally you can control the number of unused threads, that are kept
 * alive by GLib for future use. The current number can be fetched with
 * g_thread_pool_get_num_unused_threads(). The maximal number can be
 * controlled by g_thread_pool_get_max_unused_threads() and
 * g_thread_pool_set_max_unused_threads(). All currently unused threads
 * can be stopped by calling g_thread_pool_stop_unused_threads().
