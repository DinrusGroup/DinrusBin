/**
 * Description
 * There is a group of functions which wrap the common POSIX functions
 * dealing with filenames (g_open(), g_rename(), g_mkdir(), g_stat(),
 * g_unlink(), g_remove(), g_fopen(), g_freopen()). The point of these
 * wrappers is to make it possible to handle file names with any Unicode
 * characters in them on Windows without having to use ifdefs and the
 * wide character API in the application code.
 * The pathname argument should be in the GLib file name encoding. On
 * POSIX this is the actual on-disk encoding which might correspond to
 * the locale settings of the process (or the
 * G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment variable), or not.
 * On Windows the GLib file name encoding is UTF-8. Note that the
 * Microsoft C library does not use UTF-8, but has separate APIs for
 * current system code page and wide characters (UTF-16). The GLib
 * wrappers call the wide character API if present (on modern Windows
 * systems), otherwise convert to/from the system code page.
 * Another group of functions allows to open and read directories
 * in the GLib file name encoding. These are g_dir_open(),
 * g_dir_read_name(), g_dir_rewind(), g_dir_close().
