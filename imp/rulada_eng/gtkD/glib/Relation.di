/**
 * Description
 * A GRelation is a table of data which can be indexed on any number of fields,
 * rather like simple database tables. A GRelation contains a number of
 * records, called tuples. Each record contains a number of fields.
 * Records are not ordered, so it is not possible to find the record at a
 * particular index.
 * Note that GRelation tables are currently limited to 2 fields.
 * To create a GRelation, use g_relation_new().
 * To specify which fields should be indexed, use g_relation_index().
 * Note that this must be called before any tuples are added to the GRelation.
 * To add records to a GRelation use g_relation_insert().
 * To determine if a given record appears in a GRelation, use
 * g_relation_exists(). Note that fields are compared directly, so pointers
 * must point to the exact same position (i.e. different copies of the same
 * string will not match.)
 * To count the number of records which have a particular value in a given
 * field, use g_relation_count().
 * To get all the records which have a particular value in a given field,
 * use g_relation_select(). To access fields of the resulting records,
 * use g_tuples_index(). To free the resulting records use g_tuples_destroy().
 * To delete all records which have a particular value in a given field,
 * use g_relation_delete().
 * To destroy the GRelation, use g_relation_destroy().
 * To help debug GRelation objects, use g_relation_print().
