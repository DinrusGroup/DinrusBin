/**
 * Description
 * This helper structure holds the relevant values for tracking the region of
 * interest in a media file, called a segment.
 * The structure can be used for two purposes:
 * performing seeks (handling seek events)
 * tracking playback regions (handling newsegment events)
 * The segment is usually configured by the application with a seek event which
 * is propagated upstream and eventually handled by an element that performs the seek.
 * The configured segment is then propagated back downstream with a newsegment event.
 * This information is then used to clip media to the segment boundaries.
 * A segment structure is initialized with gst_segment_init(), which takes a GstFormat
 * that will be used as the format of the segment values. The segment will be configured
 * with a start value of 0 and a stop/duration of -1, which is undefined. The default
 * rate and applied_rate is 1.0.
 * If the segment is used for managing seeks, the segment duration should be set with
 * gst_segment_set_duration(). The public duration field contains the duration of the
 * segment. When using the segment for seeking, the start and time members should
 * normally be left to their default 0 value. The stop position is left to -1 unless
 * explicitly configured to a different value after a seek event.
 * The current position in the segment should be set with the gst_segment_set_last_stop().
 * The public last_stop field contains the last set stop position in the segment.
 * For elements that perform seeks, the current segment should be updated with the
 * gst_segment_set_seek() and the values from the seek event. This method will update
 * all the segment fields. The last_pos field will contain the new playback position.
 * If the cur_type was different from GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE, playback continues from
 * the last_pos position, possibly with updated flags or rate.
 * For elements that want to use GstSegment to track the playback region, use
 * gst_segment_set_newsegment() to update the segment fields with the information from
 * the newsegment event. The gst_segment_clip() method can be used to check and clip
 * the media data to the segment boundaries.
 * For elements that want to synchronize to the pipeline clock, gst_segment_to_running_time()
 * can be used to convert a timestamp to a value that can be used to synchronize
 * to the clock. This function takes into account all accumulated segments as well as
 * any rate or applied_rate conversions.
 * For elements that need to perform operations on media data in stream_time,
 * gst_segment_to_stream_time() can be used to convert a timestamp and the segment
 * info to stream time (which is always between 0 and the duration of the stream).
