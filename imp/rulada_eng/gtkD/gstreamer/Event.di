/**
 * Description
 * The event class provides factory methods to construct and functions query
 * (parse) events.
 * Events are usually created with gst_event_new_*() which takes event-type
 * specific parameters as arguments.
 * To send an event application will usually use gst_element_send_event() and
 * elements will use gst_pad_send_event() or gst_pad_push_event().
 * The event should be unreffed with gst_event_unref() if it has not been sent.
 * Events that have been received can be parsed with their respective
 * gst_event_parse_*() functions.
 * Events are passed between elements in parallel to the data stream. Some events
 * are serialized with buffers, others are not. Some events only travel downstream,
 * others only upstream. Some events can travel both upstream and downstream.
 * The events are used to signal special conditions in the datastream such as
 * EOS (end of stream) or the start of a new stream-segment.
 * Events are also used to flush the pipeline of any pending data.
 * Most of the event API is used inside plugins. Applications usually only
 * construct and use seek events.
 * To do that gst_event_new_seek() is used to create a seek event. It takes
 * the needed parameters to specity seeking time and mode.
 * Example8.performing a seek on a pipeline
 *  GstEvent *event;
 *  gboolean result;
 *  ...
 *  // construct a seek event to play the media from second 2 to 5, flush
 *  // the pipeline to decrease latency.
 *  event = gst_event_new_seek (1.0,
 *  GST_FORMAT_TIME,
 *  GST_SEEK_FLAG_FLUSH,
 *  GST_SEEK_TYPE_SET, 2 * GST_SECOND,
 *  GST_SEEK_TYPE_SET, 5 * GST_SECOND);
 *  ...
 *  result = gst_element_send_event (pipeline, event);
 *  if (!result)
 *  g_warning ("seek failed");
