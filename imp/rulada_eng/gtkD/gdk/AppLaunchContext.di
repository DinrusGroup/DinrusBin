/**
 * Description
 * GdkAppLaunchContext is an implementation of GAppLaunchContext that
 * handles launching an application in a graphical context. It provides
 * startup notification and allows to launch applications on a specific
 * screen or workspace.
 * Example 9. Launching an application
 * GdkAppLaunchContext *context;
 * context = gdk_app_launch_context_new ();
 * gdk_app_launch_context_set_screen (my_screen);
 * gdk_app_launch_context_set_timestamp (event->time);
 * if (!g_app_info_launch_default_for_uri ("http://www.gtkD.gtk.org", context, error))
 *  g_warning ("Launching failed: %s\n", error->message);
 * g_object_unref (context);
