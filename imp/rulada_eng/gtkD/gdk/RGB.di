/**
 * Description
 * GdkRGB is a low-level module which renders RGB, grayscale, and indexed
 * colormap images to a GdkDrawable. It does this as efficiently as
 * possible, handling issues such as colormaps, visuals, dithering,
 * temporary buffers, and so on. Most code should use the higher-level
 * GdkPixbuf features in place of this module; for example,
 * gdk_draw_pixbuf() uses GdkRGB in its implementation.
 * GdkRGB allocates a color cube to use when rendering images. You can
 * set the threshold for installing colormaps with
 * gdk_rgb_set_min_colors(). The default is 5x5x5 (125). If a colorcube
 * of this size or larger can be allocated in the default colormap, then
 * that's done. Otherwise, GdkRGB creates its own private colormap.
 * Setting it to 0 means that it always tries to use the default
 * colormap, and setting it to 216 means that it always creates a private
 * one if it cannot allocate the 6x6x6 colormap in the default. If you
 * always want a private colormap (to avoid consuming too many colormap
 * entries for other apps, say), you can use
 * gdk_rgb_set_install(TRUE).
 * Setting the value greater than 216 exercises a bug in older versions
 * of GdkRGB. Note, however, that setting it to 0 doesn't let you get
 * away with ignoring the colormap and visual - a colormap is always
 * created in grayscale and direct color modes, and the visual is changed
 * in cases where a "better" visual than the default is available.
 * If GDK is built with the Sun mediaLib library, the GdkRGB functions are
 * accelerated using mediaLib, which provides hardware acceleration on Intel,
 * AMD, and Sparc chipsets. If desired, mediaLib support can be turned off
 * by setting the GDK_DISABLE_MEDIALIB environment variable.
