/**
 * Description
 * The GMount interface represents user-visible mounts. Note, when
 * porting from GnomeVFS, GMount is the moral equivalent of GnomeVFSVolume.
 * GMount is a "mounted" filesystem that you can access. Mounted is in
 * quotes because it's not the same as a unix mount, it might be a gvfs
 * mount, but you can still access the files on it if you use GIO. Might or
 * might not be related to a volume object.
 * Unmounting a GMount instance is an asynchronous operation. For
 * more information about asynchronous operations, see GAsyncReady
 * and GSimpleAsyncReady. To unmount a GMount instance, first call
 * g_mount_unmount_with_operation() with (at least) the GMount instance and a
 * GAsyncReadyCallback. The callback will be fired when the
 * operation has resolved (either with success or failure), and a
 * GAsyncReady structure will be passed to the callback. That
 * callback should then call g_mount_unmount_with_operation_finish() with the GMount
 * and the GAsyncReady data to see if the operation was completed
 * successfully. If an error is present when g_mount_unmount_with_operation_finish()
 * is called, then it will be filled with any error information.
