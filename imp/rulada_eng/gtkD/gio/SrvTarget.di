/**
 * Description
 * SRV (service) records are used by some network protocols to provide
 * service-specific aliasing and load-balancing. For example, XMPP
 * (Jabber) uses SRV records to locate the XMPP server for a domain;
 * rather than connecting directly to "example.com" or assuming a
 * specific server hostname like "xmpp.example.com", an XMPP client
 * would look up the "xmpp-client" SRV record for "example.com", and
 * then connect to whatever host was pointed to by that record.
 * You can use g_resolver_lookup_service() or
 * g_resolver_lookup_service_async() to find the GSrvTargets
 * for a given service. However, if you are simply planning to connect
 * to the remote service, you can use GNetworkService's
 * GSocketConnectable interface and not need to worry about
 * GSrvTarget at all.
