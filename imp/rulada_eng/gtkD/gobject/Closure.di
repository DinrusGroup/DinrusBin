/**
 * Description
 * A GClosure represents a callback supplied by the programmer. It
 * will generally comprise a function of some kind and a marshaller
 * used to call it. It is the reponsibility of the marshaller to
 * convert the arguments for the invocation from GValues into
 * a suitable form, perform the callback on the converted arguments,
 * and transform the return value back into a GValue.
 * In the case of C programs, a closure usually just holds a pointer
 * to a function and maybe a data argument, and the marshaller
 * converts between GValue and native C types. The GObject
 * library provides the GCClosure type for this purpose. Bindings for
 * other languages need marshallers which convert between GValues and suitable representations in the runtime of the language in
 * order to use functions written in that languages as callbacks.
 * Within GObject, closures play an important role in the
 * implementation of signals. When a signal is registered, the
 * c_marshaller argument to g_signal_new() specifies the default C
 * marshaller for any closure which is connected to this
 * signal. GObject provides a number of C marshallers for this
 * purpose, see the g_cclosure_marshal_*() functions. Additional C
 * marshallers can be generated with the glib-genmarshal utility. Closures
 * can be explicitly connected to signals with
 * g_signal_connect_closure(), but it usually more convenient to let
 * GObject create a closure automatically by using one of the
 * g_signal_connect_*() functions which take a callback function/user
 * data pair.
 * Using closures has a number of important advantages over a simple
 * callback function/data pointer combination:
 * Closures allow the callee to get the types of the callback parameters,
 * which means that language bindings don't have to write individual glue
 * for each callback type.
 * The reference counting of GClosure makes it easy to handle reentrancy
 * right; if a callback is removed while it is being invoked, the closure
 * and its parameters won't be freed until the invocation finishes.
 * g_closure_invalidate() and invalidation notifiers allow callbacks to be
 * automatically removed when the objects they point to go away.
