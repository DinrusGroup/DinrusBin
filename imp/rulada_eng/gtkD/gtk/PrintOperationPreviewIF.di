/**
 * Description
 * GtkPrintOperation is the high-level, portable printing API. It looks
 * a bit different than other GTK+ dialogs such as the GtkFileChooser,
 * since some platforms don't expose enough infrastructure to implement
 * a good print dialog. On such platforms, GtkPrintOperation uses the
 * native print dialog. On platforms which do not provide a native
 * print dialog, GTK+ uses its own, see GtkPrintUnixDialog.
 * The typical way to use the high-level printing API is to create a
 * GtkPrintOperation object with gtk_print_operation_new() when the user
 * selects to print. Then you set some properties on it, e.g. the page size,
 * any GtkPrintSettings from previous print operations, the number of pages,
 * the current page, etc.
 * Then you start the print operation by calling gtk_print_operation_run().
 * It will then show a dialog, let the user select a printer and options.
 * When the user finished the dialog various signals will be emitted on the
 * GtkPrintOperation, the main one being ::draw-page, which you are supposed
 * to catch and render the page on the provided GtkPrintContext using Cairo.
 * Example 46. The high-level printing API
 * static GtkPrintSettings *settings = NULL;
 * static void
 * do_print (void)
 * {
	 *  GtkPrintOperation *print;
	 *  GtkPrintOperationResult res;
	 *  print = gtk_print_operation_new ();
	 *  if (settings != NULL)
	 *  gtk_print_operation_set_print_settings (print, settings);
	 *  g_signal_connect (print, "begin_print", G_CALLBACK (begin_print), NULL);
	 *  g_signal_connect (print, "draw_page", G_CALLBACK (draw_page), NULL);
	 *  res = gtk_print_operation_run (print, GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_ACTION_PRINT_DIALOG,
	 *  GTK_WINDOW (main_window), NULL);
	 *  if (res == GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_APPLY)
	 *  {
		 *  if (settings != NULL)
		 *  g_object_unref (settings);
		 *  settings = g_object_ref (gtk_print_operation_get_print_settings (print));
	 *  }
	 *  g_object_unref (print);
 * }
 * By default GtkPrintOperation uses an external application to do
 * print preview. To implement a custom print preview, an application
 * must connect to the preview signal. The functions
 * gtk_print_operation_print_preview_render_page(),
 * gtk_print_operation_preview_end_preview() and
 * gtk_print_operation_preview_is_selected() are useful
 * when implementing a print preview.
 * Printing support was added in GTK+ 2.10.
