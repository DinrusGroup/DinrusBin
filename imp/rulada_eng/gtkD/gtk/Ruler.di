/**
 * Description
 * Note
 *  This widget is considered too specialized/little-used for
 *  GTK+, and will in the future be moved to some other package. If
 *  your application needs this widget, feel free to use it, as the
 *  widget does work and is useful in some applications; it's just not
 *  of general interest. However, we are not accepting new features for
 *  the widget, and it will eventually move out of the GTK+
 *  distribution.
 * The GTKRuler widget is a base class for horizontal and vertical rulers. Rulers
 * are used to show the mouse pointer's location in a window. The ruler can either
 * be horizontal or vertical on the window. Within the ruler a small triangle
 * indicates the location of the mouse relative to the horizontal or vertical
 * ruler. See GtkHRuler to learn how to create a new horizontal ruler. See
 * GtkVRuler to learn how to create a new vertical ruler.
