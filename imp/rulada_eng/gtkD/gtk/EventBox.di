	 * In an invisible window event box, the window that the
	 * event box creates is a GDK_INPUT_ONLY window, which
	 * means that it is invisible and only serves to receive
	 * events.
	 * A visible window event box creates a visible (GDK_INPUT_OUTPUT)
	 * window that acts as the parent window for all the widgets
	 * contained in the event box.
	 * You should generally make your event box invisible if
	 * you just want to trap events. Creating a visible window
	 * may cause artifacts that are visible to the user, especially
	 * if the user is using a theme with gradients or pixmaps.
	 * The main reason to create a non input-only event box is if
	 * you want to set the background to a different color or
	 * draw on it.
	 * Note
	 * There is one unexpected issue for an invisible event box that has its
	 * window below the child. (See gtk_event_box_set_above_child().)
	 * Since the input-only window is not an ancestor window of any windows
	 * that descendent widgets of the event box create, events on these
	 * windows aren't propagated up by the windowing system, but only by GTK+.
	 * The practical effect of this is if an event isn't in the event
	 * mask for the descendant window (see gtk_widget_add_events()),
	 * it won't be received by the event box.
	 * This problem doesn't occur for visible event boxes, because in
	 * that case, the event box window is actually the ancestor of the
	 * descendant windows, not just at the same place on the screen.

	 * Params:
	 * visibleWindow =  boolean value
