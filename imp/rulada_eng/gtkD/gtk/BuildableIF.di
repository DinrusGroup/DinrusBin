/**
 * Description
 * In order to allow construction from a GtkBuilder
 * UI description, an object class must implement the
 * GtkBuildable interface. The interface includes methods for setting
 * names and properties of objects, parsing custom tags, constructing
 * child objects.
 * The GtkBuildable interface is implemented by all widgets and
 * many of the non-widget objects that are provided by GTK+. The
 * main user of this interface is GtkBuilder, there should be
 * very little need for applications to call any
 * gtk_buildable_... functions.
