/**
 * Description
 * GTK+ supports Drag-and-Drop in tree views with a high-level and a low-level
 * API.
 * The low-level API consists of the GTK+ DND API, augmented by some treeview
 * utility functions: gtk_tree_view_set_drag_dest_row(),
 * gtk_tree_view_get_drag_dest_row(), gtk_tree_view_get_dest_row_at_pos(),
 * gtk_tree_view_create_row_drag_icon(), gtk_tree_set_row_drag_data() and
 * gtk_tree_get_row_drag_data(). This API leaves a lot of flexibility, but
 * nothing is done automatically, and implementing advanced features like
 * hover-to-open-rows or autoscrolling on top of this API is a lot of work.
 * On the other hand, if you write to the high-level API, then all the
 * bookkeeping of rows is done for you, as well as things like hover-to-open
 * and auto-scroll, but your models have to implement the
 * GtkTreeDragSource and GtkTreeDragDest interfaces.
