/**
   Implements the $(LINK2 http://tinyurl.com/2zb9yr,secant method) for
   finding a root of the function $(D_PARAM f) starting from points
   [xn_1, x_n] (ideally close to the root). $(D_PARAM Num) may be
   $(D_PARAM float), $(D_PARAM double), or $(D_PARAM real).

Example:

----
float f(float x) {
    return cos(x) - x*x*x;
}
final x = secantMethod(&f, 0f, 1f);
assert(approxEqual(x, 0.865474));
