/**
 * Description
 * AtkAction should be implemented by instances of AtkObject classes with
 * which the user can interact directly, i.e. buttons, checkboxes,
 * scrollbars, e.g. components which are not "passive"
 * providers of UI information.
 * Exceptions: when the user interaction is already covered by
 * another appropriate interface such as AtkEditableText (insert/delete
 * test, etc.) or AtkValue (set value) then these actions should not be
 * exposed by AtkAction as well.
 * Also note that the AtkAction API is limited in that parameters may not
 * be passed to the object being activated; thus the action must be
 * self-contained and specifiable via only a single "verb". Concrete
 * examples include "press", "release", "click" for buttons, "drag"
 * (meaning initiate drag) and "drop" for drag sources and drop targets,
 * etc.
 * Though most UI interactions on components should be invocable via
 * keyboard as well as mouse, there will generally be a close mapping
 * between "mouse actions" that are possible on a component and the
 * AtkActions. Where mouse and keyboard actions are redundant in effect,
 * AtkAction should expose only one action rather than exposing redundant
 * actions if possible. By convention we have been using "mouse centric"
 * terminology for AtkAction names.
