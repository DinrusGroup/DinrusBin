/**
 * Description
 * Buffers are the basic unit of data transfer in GStreamer. The GstBuffer
 * type provides all the state necessary to define a region of memory as part
 * of a stream. Sub-buffers are also supported, allowing a smaller region of a
 * buffer to become its own buffer, with mechanisms in place to ensure that
 * neither memory space goes away prematurely.
 * Buffers are usually created with gst_buffer_new(). After a buffer has been
 * created one will typically allocate memory for it and set the size of the
 * buffer data. The following example creates a buffer that can hold a given
 * video frame with a given width, height and bits per plane.
 * Example3.Creating a buffer for a video frame
 *  GstBuffer *buffer;
 *  gint size, width, height, bpp;
 *  ...
 *  size = width * height * bpp;
 *  buffer = gst_buffer_new();
 *  GST_BUFFER_SIZE (buffer) = size;
 *  GST_BUFFER_MALLOCDATA (buffer) = g_malloc (size);
 *  GST_BUFFER_DATA (buffer) = GST_BUFFER_MALLOCDATA (buffer);
 *  ...
 * Alternatively, use gst_buffer_new_and_alloc()
 * to create a buffer with preallocated data of a given size.
 * The data pointed to by the buffer can be retrieved with the GST_BUFFER_DATA()
 * macro. The size of the data can be found with GST_BUFFER_SIZE(). For buffers
 * of size 0, the data pointer is undefined (usually NULL) and should never be used.
 * If an element knows what pad you will push the buffer out on, it should use
 * gst_pad_alloc_buffer() instead to create a buffer. This allows downstream
 * elements to provide special buffers to write in, like hardware buffers.
 * A buffer has a pointer to a GstCaps describing the media type of the data
 * in the buffer. Attach caps to the buffer with gst_buffer_set_caps(); this
 * is typically done before pushing out a buffer using gst_pad_push() so that
 * the downstream element knows the type of the buffer.
 * A buffer will usually have a timestamp, and a duration, but neither of these
 * are guaranteed (they may be set to GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE). Whenever a
 * meaningful value can be given for these, they should be set. The timestamp
 * and duration are measured in nanoseconds (they are GstClockTime values).
 * A buffer can also have one or both of a start and an end offset. These are
 * media-type specific. For video buffers, the start offset will generally be
 * the frame number. For audio buffers, it will be the number of samples
 * produced so far. For compressed data, it could be the byte offset in a
 * source or destination file. Likewise, the end offset will be the offset of
 * the end of the buffer. These can only be meaningfully interpreted if you
 * know the media type of the buffer (the GstCaps set on it). Either or both
 * can be set to GST_BUFFER_OFFSET_NONE.
 * gst_buffer_ref() is used to increase the refcount of a buffer. This must be
 * done when you want to keep a handle to the buffer after pushing it to the
 * next element.
 * To efficiently create a smaller buffer out of an existing one, you can
 * use gst_buffer_create_sub().
 * If a plug-in wants to modify the buffer data in-place, it should first obtain
 * a buffer that is safe to modify by using gst_buffer_make_writable(). This
 * function is optimized so that a copy will only be made when it is necessary.
 * A plugin that only wishes to modify the metadata of a buffer, such as the
 * offset, timestamp or caps, should use gst_buffer_make_metadata_writable(),
 * which will create a subbuffer of the original buffer to ensure the caller
 * has sole ownership, and not copy the buffer data.
 * Several flags of the buffer can be set and unset with the
 * GST_BUFFER_FLAG_SET() and GST_BUFFER_FLAG_UNSET() macros. Use
 * GST_BUFFER_FLAG_IS_SET() to test if a certain GstBufferFlag is set.
 * Buffers can be efficiently merged into a larger buffer with
 * gst_buffer_merge() and gst_buffer_span() if the gst_buffer_is_span_fast()
 * function returns TRUE.
 * An element should either unref the buffer or push it out on a src pad
 * using gst_pad_push() (see GstPad).
 * Buffers are usually freed by unreffing them with gst_buffer_unref(). When
 * the refcount drops to 0, any data pointed to by GST_BUFFER_MALLOCDATA() will
 * also be freed.
