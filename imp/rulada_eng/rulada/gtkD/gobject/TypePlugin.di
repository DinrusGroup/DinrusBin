/**
 * Description
 * The GObject type system supports dynamic loading of types. The
 * GTypePlugin interface is used to handle the lifecycle of
 * dynamically loaded types. It goes as follows:
 *  The type is initially introduced (usually upon loading the module
 *  the first time, or by your main application that knows what modules
 *  introduces what types), like this:
 *  new_type_id = g_type_register_dynamic (parent_type_id,
 *  "TypeName",
 *  new_type_plugin,
 *  type_flags);
 *  where new_type_plugin is an implementation of the
 *  GTypePlugin interface.
 *  The type's implementation is referenced, e.g. through
 *  g_type_class_ref() or through g_type_create_instance() (this is
 *  being called by g_object_new()) or through one of the above done on
 *  a type derived from new_type_id.
 *  This causes the type system to load the type's implementation by calling
 *  g_type_plugin_use() and g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() on
 *  new_type_plugin.
 *  At some point the type's implementation isn't required anymore, e.g. after
 *  g_type_class_unref() or g_type_free_instance() (called when the reference
 *  count of an instance drops to zero).
 *  This causes the type system to throw away the information retrieved from
 *  g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() and then it calls
 *  g_type_plugin_unuse() on new_type_plugin.
 *  Things may repeat from the second step.
 * So basically, you need to implement a GTypePlugin type that
 * carries a use_count, once use_count goes from zero to one, you need
 * to load the implementation to successfully handle the upcoming
 * g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() call. Later, maybe after
 * succeeding use/unuse calls, once use_count drops to zero, you can
 * unload the implementation again. The type system makes sure to call
 * g_type_plugin_use() and g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() again
 * when the type is needed again.
 * GTypeModule is an implementation of GTypePlugin that already
 * implements most of this except for the actual module loading and
 * unloading. It even handles multiple registered types per module.
