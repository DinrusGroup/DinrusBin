/**
 * Description
 * The GSequence data structure has the API of a list, but is
 * implemented internally with a balanced binary tree. This means that it
 * is possible to maintain a sorted list of n elements in time O(n log
 * n). The data contained in each element can be either integer values, by
 * using of the
 * Type Conversion Macros,
 * or simply pointers to any type of data.
 * A GSequence is accessed through iterators,
 * represented by a GSequenceIter. An iterator represents a position
 * between two elements of the sequence. For example, the
 * begin iterator represents the gap immediately
 * before the first element of the sequence, and the
 * end iterator represents the gap immediately
 * after the last element. In an empty sequence, the begin and end
 * iterators are the same.
 * Some methods on GSequence operate on ranges of items. For example
 * g_sequence_foreach_range() will call a user-specified function on each
 * element with the given range. The range is delimited by the gaps
 * represented by the passed-in iterators, so if you pass in the begin
 * and end iterators, the range in question is the entire sequence.
 * The function g_sequence_get() is used with an iterator to access the
 * element immediately following the gap that the iterator
 * represents. The iterator is said to point to
 * that element.
 * Iterators are stable across most operations on a GSequence. For
 * example an iterator pointing to some element of a sequence will
 * continue to point to that element even after the sequence is
 * sorted. Even moving an element to another sequence using for example
 * g_sequence_move_range() will not invalidate the iterators pointing to
 * it. The only operation that will invalidate an iterator is when the
 * element it points to is removed from any sequence.
