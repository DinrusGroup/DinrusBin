/**
 * Description
 * GLib provides a standard method of reporting errors from a called function to
 * the calling code. (This is the same problem solved by exceptions in other
 * languages.) It's important to understand that this method is both a
 * data type (the GError object) and a set of
 * rules. If you use GError incorrectly, then your code will not
 * properly interoperate with other code that uses GError, and users of your API
 * will probably get confused.
 * First and foremost: GError should only be used to report
 * recoverable runtime errors, never to report programming errors. If
 * the programmer has screwed up, then you should use g_warning(),
 * g_return_if_fail(), g_assert(), g_error(), or some similar facility.
 * (Incidentally, remember that the g_error() function should
 * only be used for programming errors, it should not be used
 * to print any error reportable via GError.)
 * Examples of recoverable runtime errors are "file not found" or "failed to parse
 * input." Examples of programming errors are "NULL passed to strcmp()" or
 * "attempted to free the same pointer twice." These two kinds of errors are
 * fundamentally different: runtime errors should be handled or reported to the
 * user, programming errors should be eliminated by fixing the bug in the program.
 * This is why most functions in GLib and GTK+ do not use the GError facility.
 * Functions that can fail take a return location for a GError as their last argument.
 * For example:
 * gboolean g_file_get_contents (const gchar *filename,
 * 	 gchar **contents,
 *  gsize *length,
 *  GError **error);
 * If you pass a non-NULL value for the error argument, it should
 * point to a location where an error can be placed. For example:
 * gchar *contents;
 * GError *err = NULL;
 * g_file_get_contents ("foo.txt", contents, NULL, err);
 * g_assert ((contents == NULL  err != NULL) || (contents != NULL  err == NULL));
 * if (err != NULL)
 *  {
	 *  /+* Report error to user, and free error +/
	 *  g_assert (contents == NULL);
	 *  fprintf (stderr, "Unable to read file: %s\n", err->message);
	 *  g_error_free (err);
 *  }
 * else
 *  {
	 *  /+* Use file contents +/
	 *  g_assert (contents != NULL);
 *  }
 * Note that err != NULL in this example is a
 * reliable indicator of whether
 * g_file_get_contents() failed. Additionally, g_file_get_contents() returns
 * a boolean which indicates whether it was successful.
 * Because g_file_get_contents() returns FALSE on failure, if you are only
 * interested in whether it failed and don't need to display an error message, you
 * can pass NULL for the error argument:
 * if (g_file_get_contents ("foo.txt", contents, NULL, NULL)) /+* ignore errors +/
 *  /+* no error occurred +/ ;
 * else
 *  /+* error +/ ;
 * The GError object contains three fields: domain indicates
 * the module the error-reporting function is located in, code
 * indicates the specific error that occurred, and message is a
 * user-readable error message with as many details as possible. Several functions
 * are provided to deal with an error received from a called function:
 * g_error_matches() returns TRUE if the error matches a given domain and code,
 * g_propagate_error() copies an error into an error location (so the calling
 * function will receive it), and g_clear_error() clears an error location by
 * freeing the error and resetting the location to NULL. To display an error to the
 * user, simply display error->message, perhaps along with
 * additional context known only to the calling function (the file being opened, or
 * whatever -- though in the g_file_get_contents() case,
 * error->message already contains a filename).
 * When implementing a function that can report errors, the basic tool is
 * g_set_error(). Typically, if a fatal error occurs you want to g_set_error(),
 * then return immediately. g_set_error() does nothing if the error location passed
 * to it is NULL. Here's an example:
 * gint
 * foo_open_file (GError **error)
 * {
	 *  gint fd;
	 *  fd = open ("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
	 *  if (fd < 0)
	 *  {
		 *  g_set_error (error,
		 *  FOO_ERROR, /+* error domain +/
		 *  FOO_ERROR_BLAH, /+* error code +/
		 *  "Failed to open file: %s", /+* error message format string +/
		 *  g_strerror (errno));
		 *  return -1;
	 *  }
	 *  else
	 *  return fd;
 * }
 * Things are somewhat more complicated if you yourself call another function that
 * can report a GError. If the sub-function indicates fatal errors in some way
 * other than reporting a GError, such as by returning TRUE on success, you can
 * simply do the following:
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
	 *  g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
	 *  if (!sub_function_that_can_fail (err))
	 *  {
		 *  /+* assert that error was set by the sub-function +/
		 *  g_assert (err == NULL || *err != NULL);
		 *  return FALSE;
	 *  }
	 *  /+* otherwise continue, no error occurred +/
	 *  g_assert (err == NULL || *err == NULL);
 * }
 * If the sub-function does not indicate errors other than by reporting a GError,
 * you need to create a temporary GError since the passed-in one may be NULL.
 * g_propagate_error() is intended for use in this case.
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
	 *  GError *tmp_error;
	 *  g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
	 *  tmp_error = NULL;
	 *  sub_function_that_can_fail (tmp_error);
	 *  if (tmp_error != NULL)
	 *  {
		 *  /+* store tmp_error in err, if err != NULL,
		 *  * otherwise call g_error_free() on tmp_error
		 *  +/
		 *  g_propagate_error (err, tmp_error);
		 *  return FALSE;
	 *  }
	 *  /+* otherwise continue, no error occurred +/
 * }
 * Error pileups are always a bug. For example, this code is incorrect:
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
	 *  GError *tmp_error;
	 *  g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
	 *  tmp_error = NULL;
	 *  sub_function_that_can_fail (tmp_error);
	 *  other_function_that_can_fail (tmp_error);
	 *  if (tmp_error != NULL)
	 *  {
		 *  g_propagate_error (err, tmp_error);
		 *  return FALSE;
	 *  }
 * }
 * tmp_error should be checked immediately after
 * sub_function_that_can_fail(), and either cleared or propagated upward. The rule
 * is: after each error, you must either handle the error, or return it to the
 * calling function. Note that passing NULL for the error location is the
 * equivalent of handling an error by always doing nothing about it. So the
 * following code is fine, assuming errors in sub_function_that_can_fail() are not
 * fatal to my_function_that_can_fail():
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
	 *  GError *tmp_error;
	 *  g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
	 *  sub_function_that_can_fail (NULL); /+* ignore errors +/
	 *  tmp_error = NULL;
	 *  other_function_that_can_fail (tmp_error);
	 *  if (tmp_error != NULL)
	 *  {
		 *  g_propagate_error (err, tmp_error);
		 *  return FALSE;
	 *  }
 * }
 * Note that passing NULL for the error location ignores
 * errors; it's equivalent to try { sub_function_that_can_fail(); } catch
 * (...) {} in C++. It does not mean to leave errors
 * unhandled; it means to handle them by doing nothing.
 * Error domains and codes are conventionally named as follows:
 * The error domain is called
 * <NAMESPACE>_<MODULE>_ERROR, for example
 * G_SPAWN_ERROR or G_THREAD_ERROR:
 * #define G_SPAWN_ERROR g_spawn_error_quark ()
 * GQuark
 * g_spawn_error_quark (void)
 * {
	 *  return g_quark_from_static_string ("g-spawn-error-quark");
 * }
 * The error codes are in an enumeration called
 * <Namespace><Module>Error; for example,
 * GThreadError or GSpawnError.
 * Members of the error code enumeration are called <NAMESPACE>_<MODULE>_ERROR_<CODE>, for example G_SPAWN_ERROR_FORK or G_THREAD_ERROR_AGAIN.
 * If there's a "generic" or "unknown" error code for unrecoverable errors it
 * doesn't make sense to distinguish with specific codes, it should be called
 * <NAMESPACE>_<MODULE>_ERROR_FAILED, for
 * example G_SPAWN_ERROR_FAILED or G_THREAD_ERROR_FAILED.
 * Summary of rules for use of ""
 *  Do not report programming errors via GError.
 *  The last argument of a function that returns an error should be a
 *  location where a GError can be placed (i.e. "GError** error"). If
 *  GError is used with varargs, the GError** should be the last
 *  argument before the "...".
 *  The caller may pass NULL for the GError** if they are not interested
 *  in details of the exact error that occurred.
 *  If NULL is passed for the GError** argument, then errors should
 *  not be returned to the caller, but your function should still
 *  abort and return if an error occurs. That is, control flow should
 *  not be affected by whether the caller wants to get a GError.
 *  If a GError is reported, then your function by definition
 *  had a fatal failure and did not complete whatever it was supposed
 *  to do. If the failure was not fatal, then you handled it
 *  and you should not report it. If it was fatal, then you must report it
 *  and discontinue whatever you were doing immediately.
 *  A GError* must be initialized to NULL before passing its address to
 *  a function that can report errors.
 *  "Piling up" errors is always a bug. That is, if you assign a new
 *  GError to a GError* that is non-NULL, thus overwriting the previous
 *  error, it indicates that you should have aborted the operation instead
 *  of continuing. If you were able to continue, you should have cleared
 *  the previous error with g_clear_error(). g_set_error() will complain
 *  if you pile up errors.
 *  By convention, if you return a boolean value indicating success
 *  then TRUE means success and FALSE means failure. If FALSE is returned,
 *  the error must be set to a non-NULL value.
 *  A NULL return value is also frequently used to mean that an error
 *  occurred. You should make clear in your documentation whether NULL is
 *  a valid return value in non-error cases; if NULL is a valid value,
 *  then users must check whether an error was returned to see if the
 *  function succeeded.
 *  When implementing a function that can report errors, you may want to
 *  add a check at the top of your function that the error return location
 *  is either NULL or contains a NULL error
 *  (e.g. g_return_if_fail (error == NULL || *error ==
 *  NULL);).
