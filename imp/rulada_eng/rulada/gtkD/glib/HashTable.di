/**
 * Description
 * A GHashTable provides associations between keys and values which
 * is optimized so that given a key, the associated value can be found
 * very quickly.
 * Note that neither keys nor values are copied when inserted into the
 * GHashTable, so they must exist for the lifetime of the GHashTable.
 * This means that the use of static strings is OK, but temporary
 * strings (i.e. those created in buffers and those returned by GTK+ widgets)
 * should be copied with g_strdup() before being inserted.
 * If keys or values are dynamically allocated, you must be careful to ensure
 * that they are freed when they are removed from the GHashTable, and also
 * when they are overwritten by new insertions into the GHashTable.
 * It is also not advisable to mix static strings and dynamically-allocated
 * strings in a GHashTable, because it then becomes difficult to determine
 * whether the string should be freed.
 * To create a GHashTable, use g_hash_table_new().
 * To insert a key and value into a GHashTable, use g_hash_table_insert().
 * To lookup a value corresponding to a given key, use g_hash_table_lookup()
 * and g_hash_table_lookup_extended().
 * To remove a key and value, use g_hash_table_remove().
 * To call a function for each key and value pair use g_hash_table_foreach()
 * or use a iterator to iterate over the key/value pairs in the hash table, see
 * GHashTableIter.
 * To destroy a GHashTable use g_hash_table_destroy().
