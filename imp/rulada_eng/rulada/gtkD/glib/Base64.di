/**
 * Description
 * Base64 is an encoding that allows a sequence of arbitrary bytes to be
 * encoded as a sequence of printable ASCII characters. For the definition
 * of Base64, see RFC
 * 1421 or RFC
 * 2045. Base64 is most commonly used as a MIME transfer encoding
 * for email.
 * GLib supports incremental encoding using g_base64_encode_step() and
 * g_base64_encode_close(). Incremental decoding can be done with
 * g_base64_decode_step(). To encode or decode data in one go, use
 * g_base64_encode() or g_base64_decode(). To avoid memory allocation when
 * decoding, you can use g_base64_decode_inplace().
 * Support for Base64 encoding has been added in GLib 2.12.
