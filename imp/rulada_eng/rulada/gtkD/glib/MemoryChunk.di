/**
 * Description
 * Memory chunks provide an space-efficient way to allocate equal-sized
 * pieces of memory, called atoms. However, due to the administrative
 * overhead (in particular for G_ALLOC_AND_FREE, and when used from multiple
 * threads), they are in practise often slower than direct use of g_malloc().
 * Therefore, memory chunks have been deprecated in favor of the
 * slice allocator,
 * which has been added in 2.10. All internal uses of memory chunks in
 * GLib have been converted to the g_slice API.
 * There are two types of memory chunks, G_ALLOC_ONLY, and G_ALLOC_AND_FREE.
 * G_ALLOC_ONLY chunks only allow allocation of atoms. The atoms can never
 * be freed individually. The memory chunk can only be free in its entirety.
 * G_ALLOC_AND_FREE chunks do allow atoms to be freed individually.
 * The disadvantage of this is that the memory chunk has to keep track of which
 * atoms have been freed. This results in more memory being used and a slight
 * degradation in performance.
 * To create a memory chunk use g_mem_chunk_new() or the convenience macro
 * g_mem_chunk_create().
 * To allocate a new atom use g_mem_chunk_alloc(), g_mem_chunk_alloc0(),
 * or the convenience macros g_chunk_new() or g_chunk_new0().
 * To free an atom use g_mem_chunk_free(), or the convenience macro
 * g_chunk_free(). (Atoms can only be freed if the memory chunk is created
 * with the type set to G_ALLOC_AND_FREE.)
 * To free any blocks of memory which are no longer being used, use
 * g_mem_chunk_clean(). To clean all memory chunks, use g_blow_chunks().
 * To reset the memory chunk, freeing all of the atoms, use g_mem_chunk_reset().
 * To destroy a memory chunk, use g_mem_chunk_destroy().
 * To help debug memory chunks, use g_mem_chunk_info() and g_mem_chunk_print().
 * Example 17. Using a GMemChunk
 *  GMemChunk *mem_chunk;
 *  gchar *mem[10000];
 *  gint i;
 *  /+* Create a GMemChunk with atoms 50 bytes long, and memory blocks holding
 *  100 bytes. Note that this means that only 2 atoms fit into each memory
 *  block and so isn't very efficient. +/
 *  mem_chunk = g_mem_chunk_new ("test mem chunk", 50, 100, G_ALLOC_AND_FREE);
 *  /+* Now allocate 10000 atoms. +/
 *  for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
 *  {
	 *  mem[i] = g_chunk_new (gchar, mem_chunk);
	 *  /+* Fill in the atom memory with some junk. +/
	 *  for (j = 0; j < 50; j++)
	 * 	mem[i][j] = i * j;
 *  }
 *  /+* Now free all of the atoms. Note that since we are going to destroy the
 *  GMemChunk, this wouldn't normally be used. +/
 *  for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
 *  {
	 *  g_mem_chunk_free (mem_chunk, mem[i]);
 *  }
 *  /+* We are finished with the GMemChunk, so we destroy it. +/
 *  g_mem_chunk_destroy (mem_chunk);
 * Example 18. Using a GMemChunk with data structures
 *  GMemChunk *array_mem_chunk;
 *  GRealArray *array;
 *  /+* Create a GMemChunk to hold GRealArray structures, using the
 *  g_mem_chunk_create() convenience macro. We want 1024 atoms in each
 *  memory block, and we want to be able to free individual atoms. +/
 *  array_mem_chunk = g_mem_chunk_create (GRealArray, 1024, G_ALLOC_AND_FREE);
 *  /+* Allocate one atom, using the g_chunk_new() convenience macro. +/
 *  array = g_chunk_new (GRealArray, array_mem_chunk);
 *  /+* We can now use array just like a normal pointer to a structure. +/
 *  array->data = NULL;
 *  array->len = 0;
 *  array->alloc = 0;
 *  array->zero_terminated = (zero_terminated ? 1 : 0);
 *  array->clear = (clear ? 1 : 0);
 *  array->elt_size = elt_size;
 *  /+* We can free the element, so it can be reused. +/
 *  g_chunk_free (array, array_mem_chunk);
 *  /+* We destroy the GMemChunk when we are finished with it. +/
 *  g_mem_chunk_destroy (array_mem_chunk);
