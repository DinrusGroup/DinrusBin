/**
 * Description
 * The GDate data structure represents a day between January 1, Year 1,
 * and sometime a few thousand years in the future (right now it will go
 * to the year 65535 or so, but g_date_set_parse() only parses up to the
 * year 8000 or so - just count on "a few thousand"). GDate is meant to
 * represent everyday dates, not astronomical dates or historical dates
 * or ISO timestamps or the like. It extrapolates the current Gregorian
 * calendar forward and backward in time; there is no attempt to change
 * the calendar to match time periods or locations. GDate does not store
 * time information; it represents a day.
 * The GDate implementation has several nice features; it is only a
 * 64-bit struct, so storing large numbers of dates is very efficient. It
 * can keep both a Julian and day-month-year representation of the date,
 * since some calculations are much easier with one representation or the
 * other. A Julian representation is simply a count of days since some
 * fixed day in the past; for GDate the fixed day is January 1, 1 AD.
 * ("Julian" dates in the GDate API aren't really Julian dates in the
 * technical sense; technically, Julian dates count from the start of the
 * Julian period, Jan 1, 4713 BC).
 * GDate is simple to use. First you need a "blank" date; you can get a
 * dynamically allocated date from g_date_new(), or you can declare an
 * automatic variable or array and initialize it to a sane state by
 * calling g_date_clear(). A cleared date is sane; it's safe to call
 * g_date_set_dmy() and the other mutator functions to initialize the
 * value of a cleared date. However, a cleared date is initially
 * invalid, meaning that it doesn't represent a day
 * that exists. It is undefined to call any of the date calculation
 * routines on an invalid date. If you obtain a date from a user or other
 * unpredictable source, you should check its validity with the
 * g_date_valid() predicate. g_date_valid() is also used to check for
 * errors with g_date_set_parse() and other functions that can
 * fail. Dates can be invalidated by calling g_date_clear() again.
 * It is very important to use the API to access the GDate
 * struct. Often only the day-month-year or only the Julian
 * representation is valid. Sometimes neither is valid. Use the API.
 * GLib doesn't contain any time-manipulation functions; however, there
 * is a GTime typedef and a GTimeVal struct which represents a more
 * precise time (with microseconds). You can request the current time as
 * a GTimeVal with g_get_current_time().
