/**
 * Description
 * GtkBox is an abstract widget which encapsulates functionality for a
 * particular kind of container, one that organizes a variable number of
 * widgets into a rectangular area. GtkBox has a number of derived
 * classes, e.g. GtkHBox and GtkVBox.
 * The rectangular area of a GtkBox is organized into either a single row
 * or a single column of child widgets depending upon whether the box is
 * of type GtkHBox or GtkVBox, respectively. Thus, all children of a
 * GtkBox are allocated one dimension in common, which is the height of a
 * row, or the width of a column.
 * GtkBox uses a notion of packing. Packing refers to
 * adding widgets with reference to a particular position in a
 * GtkContainer. For a GtkBox, there are two reference positions: the
 * start and the end of the box.
 * For a GtkVBox, the start is defined as the top of the box and the end is
 * defined as the bottom. For a GtkHBox the start is defined as the
 * left side and the end is defined as the right side.
 * Use repeated calls to gtk_box_pack_start() to pack widgets into a
 * GtkBox from start to end. Use gtk_box_pack_end() to add widgets from
 * end to start. You may intersperse these calls and add widgets from
 * both ends of the same GtkBox.
 * Use gtk_box_pack_start_defaults() or gtk_box_pack_end_defaults()
 * to pack widgets into a GtkBox if you do not need to specify the
 * "expand", "fill", or "padding" child properties
 * for the child to be added.
 * Because GtkBox is a GtkContainer, you may also use
 * gtk_container_add() to insert widgets into the box, and they will be
 * packed as if with gtk_box_pack_start_defaults(). Use
 * gtk_container_remove() to remove widgets from the GtkBox.
 * Use gtk_box_set_homogeneous() to specify whether or not all children
 * of the GtkBox are forced to get the same amount of space.
 * Use gtk_box_set_spacing() to determine how much space will be
 * minimally placed between all children in the GtkBox.
 * Use gtk_box_reorder_child() to move a GtkBox child to a different
 * place in the box.
 * Use gtk_box_set_child_packing() to reset the "expand",
 * "fill" and "padding" child properties.
 * Use gtk_box_query_child_packing() to query these fields.
