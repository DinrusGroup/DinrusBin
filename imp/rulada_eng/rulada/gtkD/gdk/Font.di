/**
 * Description
 * The GdkFont data type represents a font for drawing on
 * the screen. These functions provide support for
 * loading fonts, and also for determining the dimensions
 * of characters and strings when drawn with a particular
 * font.
 * Fonts in X are specified by a
 * X Logical Font Description.
 * The following description is considerably simplified.
 * For definitive information about XLFD's see the
 * X reference documentation. A X Logical Font Description (XLFD)
 * consists of a sequence of fields separated (and surrounded by) '-'
 * characters. For example, Adobe Helvetica Bold 12 pt, has the
 * full description:
 * "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-70-iso8859-1"
 * The fields in the XLFD are:
 * Foundry
 * the company or organization where the font originated.
 * Family
 * the font family (a group of related font designs).
 * Weight
 * A name for the font's typographic weight
 * For example, 'bold' or 'medium').
 * Slant
 * The slant of the font. Common values are 'R' for Roman,
 * 'I' for italoc, and 'O' for oblique.
 * Set Width
 * A name for the width of the font. For example,
 * 'normal' or 'condensed'.
 * Add Style
 * Additional information to distinguish a font from
 * other fonts of the same family.
 * Pixel Size
 * The body size of the font in pixels.
 * Point Size
 * The body size of the font in 10ths of a point.
 * (A point is 1/72.27 inch)
 * Resolution X
 * The horizontal resolution that the font was designed for.
 * Resolution Y
 * The vertical resolution that the font was designed for .
 * Spacing
 * The type of spacing for the font - can be 'p' for proportional,
 * 'm' for monospaced or 'c' for charcell.
 * Average Width
 * The average width of a glyph in the font. For monospaced
 * and charcell fonts, all glyphs in the font have this width
 * Charset Registry
 * The registration authority that owns the encoding for
 * the font. Together with the Charset Encoding field, this
 * defines the character set for the font.
 * Charset Encoding
 * An identifier for the particular character set encoding.
 * When specifying a font via a X logical Font Description,
 * '*' can be used as a wildcard to match any portion of
 * the XLFD. For instance, the above example could
 * also be specified as
 * "-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1"
 * It is generally a good idea to use wildcards for any
 * portion of the XLFD that your program does not care
 * about specifically, since that will improve the
 * chances of finding a matching font.
 * A fontset is a list of fonts
 * that is used for drawing international text that may
 * contain characters from a number of different character
 * sets. It is represented by a list of XLFD's.
 * The font for a given character set is determined by going
 * through the list of XLFD's in order. For each one, if
 * the registry and and encoding fields match the desired
 * character set, then that font is used, otherwise if
 * the XLFD contains wild-cards for the registry and encoding
 * fields, the registry and encoding for the desired character
 * set are substituted in and a lookup is done. If a match is found
 * that font is used. Otherwise, processing continues
 * on to the next font in the list.
 * The functions for determining the metrics of a string
 * come in several varieties that can take a number
 * of forms of string input:
 * 8-bit string
 *  When using functions like gdk_string_width() that
 *  take a gchar *, if the font is of type
 *  GDK_FONT_FONT and is an 8-bit font, then each
 *  gchar indexes the glyphs in the font directly.
 * 16-bit string
 *  For functions taking a gchar *, if the
 *  font is of type GDK_FONT_FONT, and is a 16-bit
 *  font, then the gchar * argument is
 *  interpreted as a guint16 * cast to
 *  a gchar * and each guint16
 *  indexes the glyphs in the font directly.
 * Multibyte string
 *  For functions taking a gchar *, if the
 *  font is of type GDK_FONT_FONTSET, then the input
 *  string is interpreted as a multibyte
 *  encoded according to the current locale. (A multibyte
 *  string is one in which each character may consist
 *  of one or more bytes, with different lengths for different
 *  characters in the string). They can be converted to and
 *  from wide character strings (see below) using
 *  gdk_wcstombs() and gdk_mbstowcs().) The string will
 *  be rendered using one or more different fonts from
 *  the fontset.
 * Wide character string
 *  For a number of the text-measuring functions, GDK
 *  provides a variant (such as gdk_text_width_wc()) which
 *  takes a GdkWChar * instead of a
 *  gchar *. The input is then taken to
 *  be a wide character string in the encoding of the
 *  current locale. (A wide character string is a string
 *  in which each character consists of several bytes,
 *  and the width of each character in the string is
 *  constant.)
 * GDK provides functions to determine a number of different
 * measurements (metrics) for a given string. (Need diagram
 * here).
 * ascent
 *  The vertical distance from the origin of the drawing
 *  opereration to the top of the drawn character.
 * descent
 *  The vertical distance from the origin of the drawing
 *  opereration to the bottom of the drawn character.
 * left bearing
 *  The horizontal distance from the origin of the drawing
 *  operation to the left-most part of the drawn character.
 * right bearing
 *  The horizontal distance from the origin of the drawing
 *  operation to the right-most part of the drawn character.
 * width bearing
 *  The horizontal distance from the origin of the drawing
 *  operation to the correct origin for drawing another
 *  string to follow the current one. Depending on the
 *  font, this could be greater than or less than the
 *  right bearing.
