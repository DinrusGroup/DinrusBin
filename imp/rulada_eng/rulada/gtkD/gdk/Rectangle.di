/**
 * Description
 * GDK provides the GdkPoint, GdkRectangle, GdkRegion and GdkSpan data types
 * for representing pixels and sets of pixels on the screen.
 * GdkPoint is a simple structure containing an x and y coordinate of a point.
 * GdkRectangle is a structure holding the position and size of a rectangle.
 * The intersection of two rectangles can be computed with
 * gdk_rectangle_intersect(). To find the union of two rectangles use
 * gdk_rectangle_union().
 * GdkRegion is an opaque data type holding a set of arbitrary pixels, and is
 * usually used for clipping graphical operations (see gdk_gc_set_clip_region()).
 * GdkSpan is a structure holding a spanline. A spanline is a horizontal line that
 * is one pixel wide. It is mainly used when rasterizing other graphics primitives.
 * It can be intersected to regions by using gdk_region_spans_intersect_foreach().
