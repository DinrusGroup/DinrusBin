/*******************************************************************************

        IWriter interface. Writers provide the means to append formatted 
        data to an IBuffer, and expose a convenient method of handling a
        variety of data types. In addition to writing native types such
        as integer and char[], writers also process any class which has
        implemented the IWritable interface (one method).

        All writers support the full set of native data types, plus their
        fundamental array variants. Operations may be chained back-to-back.

        Writers support a Java-esque put() notation. However, the Tango style
        is to place IO elements within their own parenthesis, like so:

        ---
        write (count) (" green bottles");
        ---

        Note that each written element is distict; this style is affectionately
        known as "whisper". The code below illustrates basic operation upon a
        memory buffer:
        
        ---
        auto buf = new Buffer (256);

        // map same buffer into both reader and writer
        auto read = new Reader (buf);
        auto write = new Writer (buf);

        int i = 10;
        long j = 20;
        double d = 3.14159;
        char[] c = "fred";

        // write data types out
        write (c) (i) (j) (d);

        // read them back again
        read (c) (i) (j) (d);


        // same thing again, but using put() syntax instead
        write.put(c).put(i).put(j).put(d);
        read.get(c).get(i).get(j).get(d);

        ---

        Writers may also be used with any class implementing the IWritable
        interface, along with any struct implementing an equivalent function.
