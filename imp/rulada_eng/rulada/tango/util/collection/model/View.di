         * All collections maintain a `version number'. The numbering
         * scheme is arbitrary, but is guaranteed to change upon every
         * modification that could possibly affect an elements() enumeration traversal.
         * (This is true at least within the precision of the `int' representation;
         * performing more than 2^32 operations will lead to reuse of version numbers).
         * Versioning
         * <EM>may</EM> be conservative with respect to `replacement' operations.
         * For the sake of versioning replacements may be considered as
         * removals followed by additions. Thus version numbers may change 
         * even if the old and new  elements are identical.
         * <P>
         * All element() enumerations for Mutable Collections track version
         * numbers, and raise inconsistency exceptions if the enumeration is
         * used (via get()) on a version other than the one generated
         * by the elements() method.
         * <P>
         * You can use versions to check if update operations actually have any effect
         * on observable state.
         * For example, clear() will cause cause a version change only
         * if the collection was previously non-empty.

         *   use(e.value());
         * </PRE>

         * be coerced to types that you know they are.)
         * <P>
         * All Views return instances
         * of ViewIterator, that can report the number of remaining
         * elements, and also perform consistency checks so that
         * for MutableViews, element enumerations may become 
         * invalidated if the View is modified during such a traversal
         * (which could in turn cause random effects on the ViewT.
         * TO prevent this,  ViewIterators 
         * raise CorruptedIteratorException on attempts to access
         * gets of altered Views.)
         * Note: Since all View implementations are synchronizable,
         * you may be able to guarantee that element traversals will not be
         * corrupted by using the D <CODE>synchronized</CODE> construct
         * around code blocks that do traversals. (Use with care though,
         * since such constructs can cause deadlock.)
         * <P>
         * Guarantees about the nature of the elements returned by  get of the
         * returned Iterator may vary accross sub-interfaces.
         * In all cases, the enumerations provided by elements() are guaranteed to
         * step through (via get) ALL elements in the View.
         * Unless guaranteed otherwise (for example in Seq), elements() enumerations
         * need not have any particular get() ordering so long as they
         * allow traversal of all of the elements. So, for example, two successive
         * calls to element() may produce enumerations with the same
         * elements but different get() orderings.
         * Again, sub-interfaces may provide stronger guarantees. In
         * particular, Seqs produce enumerations with gets in
         * index order, ElementSortedViews enumerations are in ascending 
         * sorted order, and KeySortedViews are in ascending order of keys.
         * Returns: an enumeration e such that
         * <PRE>
         *   e.remaining() == size() &&
         *   foreach (v in e) has(e)
