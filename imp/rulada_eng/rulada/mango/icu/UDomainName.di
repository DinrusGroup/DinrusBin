        UIDNA API implements the IDNA protocol as defined in the 
        IDNA RFC (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3490.txt).

        The RFC defines 2 operations: toAscii and toUnicode. Domain 
        labels containing non-ASCII code points are required to be 
        processed by toAscii operation before passing it to resolver 
        libraries. Domain names that are obtained from resolver 
        libraries are required to be processed by toUnicode operation 
        before displaying the domain name to the user. IDNA requires 
        that implementations process input strings with Nameprep 
        (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3491.txt), which is a profile of 
        Stringprep (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3454.txt), and then with 
        Punycode (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3492.txt). Implementations 
        of IDNA MUST fully implement Nameprep and Punycode; neither 
        Nameprep nor Punycode are optional. 
        
        The input and output of toAscii() and ToUnicode() operations are 
        Unicode and are designed to be chainable, i.e., applying toAscii() 
        or toUnicode() operations multiple times to an input string will 
        yield the same result as applying the operation once.
