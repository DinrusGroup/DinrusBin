/*******************************************************************************

        transforms Unicode text into an equivalent composed or 
        decomposed form, allowing for easier sorting and searching 
        of text. UNormalize supports the standard normalization forms 
        described in http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/

        Characters with accents or other adornments can be encoded 
        in several different ways in Unicode. For example, take the 
        character A-acute. In Unicode, this can be encoded as a single 
        character (the "composed" form):
        
                00C1 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE

        or as two separate characters (the "decomposed" form):

                0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A 0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT

        To a user of your program, however, both of these sequences 
        should be treated as the same "user-level" character "A with 
        acute accent". When you are searching or comparing text, you 
        must ensure that these two sequences are treated equivalently. 
        In addition, you must handle characters with more than one 
        accent. Sometimes the order of a character's combining accents 
        is significant, while in other cases accent sequences in different 
        orders are really equivalent.

        Similarly, the string "ffi" can be encoded as three separate 
        letters:

                0066 LATIN SMALL LETTER F 0066 LATIN SMALL LETTER F 
                0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I

        or as the single character

                FB03 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI

        The ffi ligature is not a distinct semantic character, and strictly 
        speaking it shouldn't be in Unicode at all, but it was included for 
        compatibility with existing character sets that already provided it. 
        The Unicode standard identifies such characters by giving them 
        "compatibility" decompositions into the corresponding semantic 
        characters. When sorting and searching, you will often want to use 
        these mappings.

        unorm_normalize helps solve these problems by transforming text into 
        the canonical composed and decomposed forms as shown in the first 
        example above. In addition, you can have it perform compatibility 
        decompositions so that you can treat compatibility characters the 
        same as their equivalents. Finally, UNormalize rearranges 
        accents into the proper canonical order, so that you do not have 
        to worry about accent rearrangement on your own.

        Form FCD, "Fast C or D", is also designed for collation. It allows 
        to work on strings that are not necessarily normalized with an 
        algorithm (like in collation) that works under "canonical closure", 
        i.e., it treats precomposed characters and their decomposed 
        equivalents the same.

        It is not a normalization form because it does not provide for 
        uniqueness of representation. Multiple strings may be canonically 
        equivalent (their NFDs are identical) and may all conform to FCD 
        without being identical themselves.

        The form is defined such that the "raw decomposition", the 
        recursive canonical decomposition of each character, results 
        in a string that is canonically ordered. This means that 
        precomposed characters are allowed for as long as their 
        decompositions do not need canonical reordering.

        Its advantage for a process like collation is that all NFD 
        and most NFC texts - and many unnormalized texts - already 
        conform to FCD and do not need to be normalized (NFD) for 
        such a process. The FCD quick check will return UNORM_YES 
        for most strings in practice.

        For more details on FCD see the collation design document: 
        http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/icuhtml/design/collation/ICU_collation_design.htm

        ICU collation performs either NFD or FCD normalization 
        automatically if normalization is turned on for the collator 
        object. Beyond collation and string search, normalized strings 
        may be useful for string equivalence comparisons, transliteration/
        transcription, unique representations, etc.

        The W3C generally recommends to exchange texts in NFC. Note also 
        that most legacy character encodings use only precomposed forms 
        and often do not encode any combining marks by themselves. For 
        conversion to such character encodings the Unicode text needs to 
        be normalized to NFC. For more usage examples, see the Unicode 
        Standard Annex.
