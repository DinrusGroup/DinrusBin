/*******************************************************************************

        Iterate across a set of text patterns.

        These iterators are based upon the IBuffer construct, and can
        thus be used in conjunction with other Iterators and/or Reader
        instances upon a common buffer ~ each will stay in lockstep via
        state maintained within the IBuffer.

        The content exposed via an iterator is supposed to be entirely
        read-only. All current iterators abide by this rule, but it is
        possible a user could mutate the content through a get() slice.
        To enforce the desired read-only aspect, the code would have to 
        introduce redundant copying or the compiler would have to support 
        read-only arrays.
