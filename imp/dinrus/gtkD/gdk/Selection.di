/**
 * Description
 * The X selection mechanism provides a way to transfer
 * arbitrary chunks of data between programs.
 * A selection is a essentially
 * a named clipboard, identified by a string interned
 * as a GdkAtom. By claiming ownership of a selection,
 * an application indicates that it will be responsible
 * for supplying its contents. The most common
 * selections are PRIMARY and
 * CLIPBOARD.
 * The contents of a selection can be represented in
 * a number of formats, called targets.
 * Each target is identified by an atom. A list of
 * all possible targets supported by the selection owner
 * can be retrieved by requesting the special target
 * TARGETS. When a selection is
 * retrieved, the data is accompanied by a type
 * (an atom), and a format (an integer, representing
 * the number of bits per item).
 * See Properties and Atoms
 * for more information.
 * The functions in this section only contain the lowlevel
 * parts of the selection protocol. A considerably more
 * complicated implementation is needed on top of this.
 * GTK+ contains such an implementation in the functions
 * in gtkselection.h and programmers
 * should use those functions instead of the ones presented
 * here. If you plan to implement selection handling
 * directly on top of the functions here, you should refer
 * to the X Inter-client Communication Conventions Manual
 * (ICCCM).
