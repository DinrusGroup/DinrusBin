/**
 * Description
 * The GdkImage type represents an area for drawing graphics.
 * It has now been superceded to a large extent by the much more flexible
 * GdkRGB functions.
 * To create an empty GdkImage use gdk_image_new().
 * To create a GdkImage from bitmap data use gdk_image_new_bitmap().
 * To create an image from part of a GdkWindow use gdk_drawable_get_image().
 * The image can be manipulated with gdk_image_get_pixel() and
 * gdk_image_put_pixel(), or alternatively by changing the actual pixel data.
 * Though manipulating the pixel data requires complicated code to cope with
 * the different formats that may be used.
 * To draw a GdkImage in a GdkWindow or GdkPixmap use gdk_draw_image().
 * To destroy a GdkImage use gdk_image_destroy().
