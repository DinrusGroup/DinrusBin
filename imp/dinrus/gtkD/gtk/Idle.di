/**
 * Description
 * Before using GTK+, you need to initialize it; initialization connects
 * to the window system display, and parses some standard command line
 * arguments. The gtk_init() function initializes GTK+. gtk_init() exits
 * the application if errors occur; to avoid this, use gtk_init_check().
 * gtk_init_check() allows you to recover from a failed GTK+
 * initialization - you might start up your application in text mode instead.
 * Like all GUI toolkits, GTK+ uses an event-driven programming
 * model. When the user is doing nothing, GTK+ sits in the
 * main loop and waits for input. If the user
 * performs some action - say, a mouse click - then the main loop "wakes
 * up" and delivers an event to GTK+. GTK+ forwards the event to one or
 * more widgets.
 * When widgets receive an event, they frequently emit one or more
 * signals. Signals notify your program that
 * "something interesting happened" by invoking functions you've
 * connected to the signal with g_signal_connect(). Functions connected
 * to a signal are often termed callbacks.
 * When your callbacks are invoked, you would typically take some action
 * - for example, when an Open button is clicked you might display a
 * GtkFileSelectionDialog. After a callback finishes, GTK+ will return
 * to the main loop and await more user input.
 * Example 2. Typical main function for a GTK+ application
 * int
 * main (int argc, char **argv)
 * {
	 *  /+* Initialize i18n support +/
	 *  gtk_set_locale ();
	 *  /+* Initialize the widget set +/
	 *  gtk_init (argc, argv);
	 *  /+* Create the main window +/
	 *  mainwin = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
	 *  /+* Set up our GUI elements +/
	 *  ...
	 *  /+* Show the application window +/
	 *  gtk_widget_show_all (mainwin);
	 *  /+* Enter the main event loop, and wait for user interaction +/
	 *  gtk_main ();
	 *  /+* The user lost interest +/
	 *  return 0;
 * }
 * It's OK to use the GLib main loop directly instead of gtk_main(),
 * though it involves slightly more typing. See GMainLoop in the GLib
 * documentation.
