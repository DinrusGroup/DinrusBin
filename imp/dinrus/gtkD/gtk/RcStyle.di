/**
 * Description
 * GTK+ provides resource file mechanism for configuring
 * various aspects of the operation of a GTK+ program
 * at runtime.
 * Default files
 * An application can cause GTK+ to parse a specific RC
 * file by calling gtk_rc_parse(). In addition to this,
 * certain files will be read at the end of gtk_init().
 * Unless modified, the files looked for will be
 * <SYSCONFDIR>/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
 * and .gtkrc-2.0 in the users home directory.
 * (<SYSCONFDIR> defaults to
 * /usr/local/etc. It can be changed with the
 * --prefix or --sysconfdir options when
 * configuring GTK+.) Note that although the filenames contain the version
 * number 2.0, all 2.x versions of GTK+ look for these files.
 * The set of these default files
 * can be retrieved with gtk_rc_get_default_files()
 * and modified with gtk_rc_add_default_file() and
 * gtk_rc_set_default_files().
 * Additionally, the GTK2_RC_FILES environment variable
 * can be set to a G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR_S-separated list of files
 * in order to overwrite the set of default files at runtime.
 * For each RC file, in addition to the file itself, GTK+ will look for
 * a locale-specific file that will be parsed after the main file.
 * For instance, if LANG is set to ja_JP.ujis,
 * when loading the default file ~/.gtkrc then GTK+ looks
 * for ~/.gtkrc.ja_JP and ~/.gtkrc.ja,
 * and parses the first of those that exists.
 * <hr>
 * Pathnames and patterns
 * A resource file defines a number of styles and key bindings and
 * attaches them to particular widgets. The attachment is done
 * by the widget, widget_class,
 * and class declarations. As an example
 * of such a statement:
 * widget "mywindow.*.GtkEntry" style "my-entry-class"
 * attaches the style "my-entry-class" to all
 * widgets whose widget path matches the
 * pattern "mywindow.*.GtkEntry".
 * That is, all GtkEntry widgets which are part of a GtkWindow named
 * "mywindow".
 * The patterns here are given in the standard shell glob syntax.
 * The "?" wildcard matches any character, while
 * "*" matches zero or more of any character.
 * The three types of matching are against the widget path, the
 * class path and the class hierarchy. Both the
 * widget path and the class path consist of a "."
 * separated list of all the parents of the widget and the widget itself
 * from outermost to innermost. The difference is that in the widget path,
 * the name assigned by gtk_widget_set_name() is used if present, otherwise
 * the class name of the widget, while for the class path, the class name is
 * always used.
 * Since GTK+ 2.10,widget_class paths can also contain
 * <classname> substrings, which are matching
 * the class with the given name and any derived classes. For instance,
 * widget_class "*<GtkMenuItem>.GtkLabel" style "my-style"
 * will match GtkLabel widgets which are contained in any kind of menu item.
 * So, if you have a GtkEntry named "myentry", inside of a
 * horizontal box in a window named "mywindow", then the
 * widget path is: "mywindow.GtkHBox.myentry"
 * while the class path is: "GtkWindow.GtkHBox.GtkEntry".
 * Matching against class is a little different. The pattern match is done
 * against all class names in the widgets class hierarchy (not the layout
 * hierarchy) in sequence, so the pattern:
 * class "GtkButton" style "my-style"
 * will match not just GtkButton widgets, but also GtkToggleButton and
 * GtkCheckButton widgets, since those classes derive from GtkButton.
 * Additionally, a priority can be specified for each pattern, and styles
 * override other styles first by priority, then by pattern type and then
 * by order of specification (later overrides earlier). The priorities
 * that can be specified are (highest to lowest):
 * highest
 * rc
 * theme
 * application
 * gtk
 * lowest
 * rc is the default for styles
 * read from an RC file, theme
 * is the default for styles read from theme RC files,
 * application
 * should be used for styles an application sets
 * up, and gtk is used for styles
 * that GTK+ creates internally.
 * <hr>
 * Optimizing RC Style Matches
 * Everytime a widget is created and added to the layout hierarchy of a GtkWindow
 * ("anchored" to be exact), a list of matching RC styles out of all RC styles read
 * in so far is composed.
 * For this, every RC style is matched against the widgets class path,
 * the widgets name path and widgets inheritance hierarchy.
 * As a consequence, significant slowdown can be caused by utilization of many
 * RC styles and by using RC style patterns that are slow or complicated to match
 * against a given widget.
 * The following ordered list provides a number of advices (prioritized by
 * effectiveness) to reduce the performance overhead associated with RC style
 * matches:
 *  Move RC styles for specific applications into RC files dedicated to those
 *  applications and parse application specific RC files only from
 *  applications that are affected by them.
 *  This reduces the overall amount of RC styles that have to be considered
 *  for a match across a group of applications.
 *  Merge multiple styles which use the same matching rule, for instance:
 *  style "Foo" { foo_content }
 *  class "X" style "Foo"
 *  style "Bar" { bar_content }
 *  class "X" style "Bar"
 *  is faster to match as:
 *  style "FooBar" { foo_content bar_content }
 *  class "X" style "FooBar"
 *  Use of wildcards should be avoided, this can reduce the individual RC style
 *  match to a single integer comparison in most cases.
 *  To avoid complex recursive matching, specification of full class names
 *  (for class matches) or full path names (for
 *  widget and widget_class matches)
 *  is to be preferred over shortened names
 *  containing "*" or "?".
 *  If at all necessary, wildcards should only be used at the tail or head
 *  of a pattern. This reduces the match complexity to a string comparison
 *  per RC style.
 *  When using wildcards, use of "?" should be preferred
 *  over "*". This can reduce the matching complexity from
 *  O(n^2) to O(n). For example "Gtk*Box" can be turned into
 *  "Gtk?Box" and will still match GtkHBox and GtkVBox.
 *  The use of "*" wildcards should be restricted as much
 *  as possible, because matching "A*B*C*RestString" can
 *  result in matching complexities of O(n^2) worst case.
 * <hr>
 * Toplevel declarations
 * An RC file is a text file which is composed of a sequence
 * of declarations. '#' characters delimit comments and
 * the portion of a line after a '#' is ignored when parsing
 * an RC file.
 * The possible toplevel declarations are:
 * binding name
 *  { ... }
 * Declares a binding set.
 * class pattern
 *  [ style | binding ][ : priority ]
 *  name
 * Specifies a style or binding set for a particular
 *  branch of the inheritance hierarchy.
 * include filename
 * Parses another file at this point. If
 *  filename is not an absolute filename,
 *  it is searched in the directories of the currently open RC files.
 * GTK+ also tries to load a
 *  locale-specific variant of
 *  the included file.
 * module_path path
 * Sets a path (a list of directories separated
 *  by colons) that will be searched for theme engines referenced in
 *  RC files.
 * pixmap_path path
 * Sets a path (a list of directories separated
 *  by colons) that will be searched for pixmaps referenced in
 *  RC files.
 * im_module_file pathname
 * Sets the pathname for the IM modules file. Setting this from RC files
 *  is deprecated; you should use the environment variable GTK_IM_MODULE_FILE
 *  instead.
 * style name [ =
 *  parent ] { ... }
 * Declares a style.
 * widget pattern
 *  [ style | binding ][ : priority ]
 *  name
 * Specifies a style or binding set for a particular
 *  group of widgets by matching on the widget pathname.
 * widget_class pattern
 *  [ style | binding ][ : priority ]
 *  name
 * Specifies a style or binding set for a particular
 *  group of widgets by matching on the class pathname.
 * setting = value
 * Specifies a value for a setting.
 *  Note that settings in RC files are overwritten by system-wide settings
 *  (which are managed by an XSettings manager on X11).
 * <hr>
 * Styles
 * A RC style is specified by a style
 * declaration in a RC file, and then bound to widgets
 * with a widget, widget_class,
 * or class declaration. All styles
 * applying to a particular widget are composited together
 * with widget declarations overriding
 * widget_class declarations which, in
 * turn, override class declarations.
 * Within each type of declaration, later declarations override
 * earlier ones.
 * Within a style declaration, the possible
 * elements are:
 * bg[state] =
 *  color
 *  Sets the color used for the background of most widgets.
 * fg[state] =
 *  color
 *  Sets the color used for the foreground of most widgets.
 * base[state] =
 *  color
 *  Sets the color used for the background of widgets displaying
 *  editable text. This color is used for the background
 *  of, among others, GtkText, GtkEntry, GtkList, and GtkCList.
 * text[state] =
 *  color
 *  Sets the color used for foreground of widgets using
 *  base for the background color.
 * xthickness =
 *  number
 *  Sets the xthickness, which is used for various horizontal padding
 *  values in GTK+.
 * ythickness =
 *  number
 *  Sets the ythickness, which is used for various vertical padding
 *  values in GTK+.
 * bg_pixmap[state] =
 *  pixmap
 *  Sets a background pixmap to be used in place of
 *  the bg color (or for GtkText,
 *  in place of the base color. The special
 *  value "<parent>" may be used to indicate that the widget should
 *  use the same background pixmap as its parent. The special value
 *  "<none>" may be used to indicate no background pixmap.
 * font = font
 *  Starting with GTK+ 2.0, the "font" and "fontset"
 *  declarations are ignored; use "font_name" declarations instead.
 * fontset = font
 *  Starting with GTK+ 2.0, the "font" and "fontset"
 *  declarations are ignored; use "font_name" declarations instead.
 * font_name = font
 *  Sets the font for a widget. font must be
 *  a Pango font name, e.g. "Sans Italic 10".
 *  For details about Pango font names, see
 *  pango_font_description_from_string().
 * stock["stock-id"] = { icon source specifications }
 *  Defines the icon for a stock item.
 * color["color-name"] = color specification
 *  Since 2.10, this element can be used to defines symbolic colors. See below for
 *  the syntax of color specifications.
 * engine "engine" { engine-specific
 * settings }
 *  Defines the engine to be used when drawing with this style.
 * class::property = value
 *  Sets a style property for a widget class.
 * The colors and background pixmaps are specified as a function of the
 * state of the widget. The states are:
 * NORMAL
 *  A color used for a widget in its normal state.
 * ACTIVE
 *  A variant of the NORMAL color used when the
 *  widget is in the GTK_STATE_ACTIVE state, and also for
 *  the trough of a ScrollBar, tabs of a NoteBook
 *  other than the current tab and similar areas.
 *  Frequently, this should be a darker variant
 *  of the NORMAL color.
 * PRELIGHT
 *  A color used for widgets in the GTK_STATE_PRELIGHT state. This
 *  state is the used for Buttons and MenuItems
 *  that have the mouse cursor over them, and for
 *  their children.
 * SELECTED
 *  A color used to highlight data selected by the user.
 *  for instance, the selected items in a list widget, and the
 *  selection in an editable widget.
 * INSENSITIVE
 *  A color used for the background of widgets that have
 *  been set insensitive with gtk_widget_set_sensitive().
 * Colors can be specified as a string containing a color name (GTK+ knows
 * all names from the X color database /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt),
 * in one of the hexadecimal forms #rrrrggggbbbb,
 * #rrrgggbbb, #rrggbb,
 * or #rgb, where r,
 * g and b are
 * hex digits, or they can be specified as a triplet
 * { r, g,
 * b}, where r,
 * g and b are either integers in
 * the range 0-65535 or floats in the range 0.0-1.0.
 * Since 2.10, colors can also be specified by refering to a symbolic color, as
 * follows: @color-name, or by using expressions to combine
 * colors. The following expressions are currently supported:
 * mix (factor, color1, color2)
 *  Computes a new color by mixing color1 and
 *  color2. The factor
 *  determines how close the new color is to color1.
 *  A factor of 1.0 gives pure color1, a factor of
 *  0.0 gives pure color2.
 * shade (factor, color)
 *  Computes a lighter or darker variant of color.
 *  A factor of 1.0 leaves the color unchanged, smaller
 *  factors yield darker colors, larger factors yield lighter colors.
 * lighter (color)
 *  This is an abbreviation for
 *  shade (1.3, color).
 * darker (color)
 *  This is an abbreviation for
 *  shade (0.7, color).
 * Here are some examples of color expressions:
 *  mix (0.5, "red", "blue")
 *  shade (1.5, mix (0.3, "#0abbc0", { 0.3, 0.5, 0.9 }))
 *  lighter (@foreground)
 * In a stock definition, icon sources are specified as a
 * 4-tuple of image filename or icon name, text direction, widget state, and size, in that
 * order. Each icon source specifies an image filename or icon name to use with a given
 * direction, state, and size. Filenames are specified as a string such
 * as "itemltr.png", while icon names (looked up
 * in the current icon theme), are specified with a leading
 * @, such as @"item-ltr".
 * The * character can be used as a
 * wildcard, and if direction/state/size are omitted they default to
 * *. So for example, the following specifies different icons to
 * use for left-to-right and right-to-left languages:
 * stock["my-stock-item"] =
 * {
	 *  { "itemltr.png", LTR, *, * },
 *  { "itemrtl.png", RTL, *, * }
 * }
 * This could be abbreviated as follows:
 * stock["my-stock-item"] =
 * {
	 *  { "itemltr.png", LTR },
 *  { "itemrtl.png", RTL }
 * }
 * You can specify custom icons for specific sizes, as follows:
 * stock["my-stock-item"] =
 * {
	 *  { "itemmenusize.png", *, *, "gtk-menu" },
 *  { "itemtoolbarsize.png", *, *, "gtk-large-toolbar" }
 *  { "itemgeneric.png" } /+* implicit *, *, * as a fallback +/
 * }
 * The sizes that come with GTK+ itself are "gtk-menu",
 * "gtk-small-toolbar", "gtk-large-toolbar",
 * "gtk-button", "gtk-dialog". Applications
 * can define other sizes.
 * It's also possible to use custom icons for a given state, for example:
 * stock["my-stock-item"] =
 * {
	 *  { "itemprelight.png", *, PRELIGHT },
	 *  { "iteminsensitive.png", *, INSENSITIVE },
	 *  { "itemgeneric.png" } /+* implicit *, *, * as a fallback +/
 * }
 * When selecting an icon source to use, GTK+ will consider text direction most
 * important, state second, and size third. It will select the best match based on
 * those criteria. If an attribute matches exactly (e.g. you specified
 * PRELIGHT or specified the size), GTK+ won't modify the image;
 * if the attribute matches with a wildcard, GTK+ will scale or modify the image to
 * match the state and size the user requested.
 * <hr>
 * Key bindings
 * Key bindings allow the user to specify actions to be
 * taken on particular key presses. The form of a binding
 * set declaration is:
 * binding name {
	 *  bind key {
		 *  signalname (param, ...)
		 *  ...
	 *  }
	 *  ...
 * }
 * key is a string consisting of a
 * series of modifiers followed by the name of a key. The
 * modifiers can be:
 * <alt>
 * <ctl>
 * <control>
 * <meta>
 * <hyper>
 * <super>
 * <mod1>
 * <mod2>
 * <mod3>
 * <mod4>
 * <mod5>
 * <release>
 * <shft>
 * <shift>
 * <shft> is an alias for
 * <shift>,
 * <ctl> is an alias for
 * <control>,
 *  and
 * <alt> is an alias for
 * <mod1>.
 * The action that is bound to the key is a sequence
 * of signal names (strings) followed by parameters for
 * each signal. The signals must be action signals.
 * (See g_signal_new()). Each parameter can be
 * a float, integer, string, or unquoted string
 * representing an enumeration value. The types of
 * the parameters specified must match the types of the
 * parameters of the signal.
 * Binding sets are connected to widgets in the same manner as styles,
 * with one difference: Binding sets override other binding sets first
 * by pattern type, then by priority and then by order of specification.
 * The priorities that can be specified and their default values are the
 * same as for styles.
