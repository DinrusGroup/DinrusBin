/**
 * Description
 * Description
 * GtkObject is the base class for all widgets, and for a few
 * non-widget objects such as GtkAdjustment. GtkObject predates
 * GObject; non-widgets that derive from GtkObject rather than
 * GObject do so for backward compatibility reasons.
 * GtkObjects are created with a "floating" reference count.
 * This means that the initial reference is not owned by anyone. Calling
 * g_object_unref() on a newly-created GtkObject is incorrect, the floating
 * reference has to be removed first. This can be done by anyone at any time,
 * by calling g_object_ref_sink() to convert the floating reference into a
 * regular reference. g_object_ref_sink() returns a new reference if an object
 * is already sunk (has no floating reference).
 * When you add a widget to its parent container, the parent container
 * will do this:
 *  g_object_ref_sink (G_OBJECT (child_widget));
 * This means that the container now owns a reference to the child widget
 * and the child widget has no floating reference.
 * The purpose of the floating reference is to keep the child widget alive
 * until you add it to a parent container:
 *  button = gtk_button_new ();
 *  /+* button has one floating reference to keep it alive +/
 *  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (container), button);
 *  /+* button has one non-floating reference owned by the container +/
 * GtkWindow is a special case, because GTK+ itself will ref/sink it on creation.
 * That is, after calling gtk_window_new(), the GtkWindow will have one
 * reference which is owned by GTK+, and no floating references.
 * One more factor comes into play: the "destroy" signal, emitted by the
 * gtk_object_destroy() method. The "destroy" signal asks all code owning a
 * reference to an object to release said reference. So, for example, if you call
 * gtk_object_destroy() on a GtkWindow, GTK+ will release the reference count that
 * it owns; if you call gtk_object_destroy() on a GtkButton, then the button will
 * be removed from its parent container and the parent container will release its
 * reference to the button. Because these references are released, calling
 * gtk_object_destroy() should result in freeing all memory associated with an
 * object, unless some buggy code fails to release its references in response to
 * the "destroy" signal. Freeing memory (referred to as
 * finalization only happens if the reference count reaches
 * zero.
 * Some simple rules for handling ""
 * Never call g_object_unref() unless you have previously called g_object_ref(),
 * even if you created the GtkObject. (Note: this is not
 * true for GObject; for GObject, the creator of the object owns a reference.)
 * Call gtk_object_destroy() to get rid of most objects in most cases.
 * In particular, widgets are almost always destroyed in this way.
 *  Because of the floating reference count, you don't need to
 * worry about reference counting for widgets and toplevel windows, unless you
 * explicitly call g_object_ref() yourself.
