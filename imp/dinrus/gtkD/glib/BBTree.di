/**
 * Description
 * The GTree structure and its associated functions provide a sorted collection
 * of key/value pairs optimized for searching and traversing in order.
 * To create a new GTree use g_tree_new().
 * To insert a key/value pair into a GTree use g_tree_insert().
 * To lookup the value corresponding to a given key, use g_tree_lookup() and
 * g_tree_lookup_extended().
 * To find out the number of nodes in a GTree, use g_tree_nnodes().
 * To get the height of a GTree, use g_tree_height().
 * To traverse a GTree, calling a function for each node visited in the
 * traversal, use g_tree_foreach().
 * To remove a key/value pair use g_tree_remove().
 * To destroy a GTree, use g_tree_destroy().
