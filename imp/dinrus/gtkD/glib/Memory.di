/**
 * Description
 * These functions provide support for allocating and freeing memory.
 * Note
 * If any call to allocate memory fails, the application is terminated.
 * This also means that there is no need to check if the call succeeded.
 * Note
 * It's important to match g_malloc() with g_free(), plain malloc() with free(),
 * and (if you're using C++) new with delete and new[] with delete[]. Otherwise
 * bad things can happen, since these allocators may use different memory
 * pools (and new/delete call constructors and destructors). See also
 * g_mem_set_vtable().
