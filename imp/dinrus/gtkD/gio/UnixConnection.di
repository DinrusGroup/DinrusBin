/**
 * Description
 * GSocketConnection is a GIOStream for a connected socket. They
 * can be created either by GSocketClient when connecting to a host,
 * or by GSocketListener when accepting a new client.
 * The type of the GSocketConnection object returned from these calls
 * depends on the type of the underlying socket that is in use. For
 * instance, for a TCP/IP connection it will be a GTcpConnection.
 * Chosing what type of object to construct is done with the socket
 * connection factory, and it is possible for 3rd parties to register
 * custom socket connection types for specific combination of socket
 * family/type/protocol using g_socket_connection_factory_register_type().
