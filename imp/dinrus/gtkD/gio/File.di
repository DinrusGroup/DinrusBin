/**
 * Description
 * GFile is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a
 * virtual file system. GFiles are lightweight, immutable
 * objects that do no I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that
 * GFile objects do not represent files, merely an identifier for a file. All
 * file content I/O is implemented as streaming operations (see GInputStream and
 * GOutputStream).
 * To construct a GFile, you can use:
 * g_file_new_for_path() if you have a path.
 * g_file_new_for_uri() if you have a URI.
 * g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() for a command line argument.
 * g_file_parse_name() from a utf8 string gotten from g_file_get_parse_name().
 * One way to think of a GFile is as an abstraction of a pathname. For normal
 * files the system pathname is what is stored internally, but as GFiles
 * are extensible it could also be something else that corresponds to a pathname
 * in a userspace implementation of a filesystem.
 * GFiles make up hierarchies of directories and files that correspond to the
 * files on a filesystem. You can move through the file system with GFile using
 * g_file_get_parent() to get an identifier for the parent directory, g_file_get_child()
 * to get a child within a directory, g_file_resolve_relative_path() to resolve a relative
 * path between two GFiles. There can be multiple hierarchies, so you may not
 * end up at the same root if you repeatedly call g_file_get_parent() on two different
 * files.
 * All GFiles have a basename (get with g_file_get_basename()). These names
 * are byte strings that are used to identify the file on the filesystem (relative to
 * its parent directory) and there is no guarantees that they have any particular charset
 * encoding or even make any sense at all. If you want to use filenames in a user
 * interface you should use the display name that you can get by requesting the
 * G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_DISPLAY_NAME attribute with g_file_query_info().
 * This is guaranteed to be in utf8 and can be used in a user interface. But always
 * store the real basename or the GFile to use to actually access the file, because
 * there is no way to go from a display name to the actual name.
 * Using GFile as an identifier has the same weaknesses as using a path in that
 * there may be multiple aliases for the same file. For instance, hard or
 * soft links may cause two different GFiles to refer to the same file.
 * Other possible causes for aliases are: case insensitive filesystems, short
 * and long names on Fat/NTFS, or bind mounts in Linux. If you want to check if
 * two GFiles point to the same file you can query for the
 * G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ID_FILE attribute. Note that GFile does some trivial
 * canonicalization of pathnames passed in, so that trivial differences in the
 * path string used at creation (duplicated slashes, slash at end of path, "."
 * or ".." path segments, etc) does not create different GFiles.
 * Many GFile operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions
 * to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous functions
 * simply have _async() appended to their function names. The asynchronous
 * I/O functions call a GAsyncReadyCallback which is then used to finalize
 * the operation, producing a GAsyncResult which is then passed to the
 * function's matching _finish() operation.
 * Some GFile operations do not have synchronous analogs, as they may
 * take a very long time to finish, and blocking may leave an application
 * unusable. Notable cases include:
 * g_file_mount_mountable() to mount a mountable file.
 * g_file_unmount_mountable_with_operation() to unmount a mountable file.
 * g_file_eject_mountable_with_operation() to eject a mountable file.
 * One notable feature of GFiles are entity tags, or "etags" for
 * short. Entity tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the
 * traditional mtime, and can be used to quickly determine if the file has
 * been modified from the version on the file system. See the HTTP 1.1
 * specification
 * for HTTP Etag headers, which are a very similar concept.
