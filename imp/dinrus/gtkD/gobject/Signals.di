/**
 * Description
 * The basic concept of the signal system is that of the
 * emission of a signal. Signals are introduced
 * per-type and are identified through strings. Signals introduced
 * for a parent type are available in derived types as well, so
 * basically they are a per-type facility that is inherited. A signal
 * emission mainly involves invocation of a certain set of callbacks
 * in precisely defined manner. There are two main categories of such
 * callbacks, per-object
 * [10]
 * ones and user provided ones.
 * The per-object callbacks are most often referred to as "object method
 * handler" or "default (signal) handler", while user provided callbacks are
 * usually just called "signal handler".
 * The object method handler is provided at signal creation time (this most
 * frequently happens at the end of an object class' creation), while user
 * provided handlers are frequently connected and disconnected to/from a certain
 * signal on certain object instances.
 * A signal emission consists of five stages, unless prematurely stopped:
 * 	1 - Invocation of the object method handler for G_SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST signals
 * 	2 - Invocation of normal user-provided signal handlers (after flag FALSE)
 * 	3 - Invocation of the object method handler for G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST signals
 * 	4 - Invocation of user provided signal handlers, connected with an after flag of TRUE
 * 	5 - Invocation of the object method handler for G_SIGNAL_RUN_CLEANUP signals
 * The user-provided signal handlers are called in the order they were
 * connected in.
 * All handlers may prematurely stop a signal emission, and any number of
 * handlers may be connected, disconnected, blocked or unblocked during
 * a signal emission.
 * There are certain criteria for skipping user handlers in stages 2 and 4
 * of a signal emission.
 * First, user handlers may be blocked, blocked handlers are omitted
 * during callback invocation, to return from the "blocked" state, a
 * handler has to get unblocked exactly the same amount of times
 * it has been blocked before.
 * Second, upon emission of a G_SIGNAL_DETAILED signal, an additional
 * "detail" argument passed in to g_signal_emit() has to match the detail
 * argument of the signal handler currently subject to invocation.
 * Specification of no detail argument for signal handlers (omission of the
 * detail part of the signal specification upon connection) serves as a
 * wildcard and matches any detail argument passed in to emission.
