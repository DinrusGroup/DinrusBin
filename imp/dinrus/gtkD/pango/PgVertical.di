/**
 * Description
 * Since 1.16, Pango is able to correctly lay vertical text out. In fact, it can
 * set layouts of mixed vertical and non-vertical text. This section describes
 * the types used for setting vertical text parameters.
 * The way this is implemented is through the concept of
 * gravity. Gravity of normal Latin text is south. A
 * gravity value of east means that glyphs will be rotated ninety degrees
 * counterclockwise. So, to render vertical text one needs to set the gravity
 * and rotate the layout using the matrix machinery already in place. This has
 * the huge advantage that most algorithms working on a PangoLayout do not need
 * any change as the assumption that lines run in the X direction and stack in
 * the Y direction holds even for vertical text layouts.
 * Applications should only need to set base gravity on PangoContext in use, and
 * let Pango decide the gravity assigned to each run of text. This automatically
 * handles text with mixed scripts. A very common use is to set the context base
 * gravity to auto using pango_context_set_base_gravity()
 * and rotate the layout normally. Pango will make sure that
 * Asian languages take the right form, while other scripts are rotated normally.
 * The correct way to set gravity on a layout is to set it on the context
 * associated with it using pango_context_set_base_gravity(). The context
 * of a layout can be accessed using pango_layout_get_context(). The currently
 * set base gravity of the context can be accessed using
 * pango_context_get_base_gravity() and the resolved
 * gravity of it using pango_context_get_gravity(). The resolved gravity is
 * the same as the base gravity for the most part, except that if the base
 * gravity is set to PANGO_GRAVITY_AUTO, the resolved gravity will depend
 * on the current matrix set on context, and is derived using
 * pango_gravity_get_for_matrix().
 * The next thing an application may want to set on the context is the
 * gravity hint. A PangoGravityHint instructs how
 * different scripts should react to the set base gravity.
 * Font descriptions have a gravity property too, that can be set using
 * pango_font_description_set_gravity() and accessed using
 * pango_font_description_get_gravity(). However, those are rarely useful
 * from application code and are mainly used by PangoLayout internally.
 * Last but not least, one can create PangoAttributes for gravity
 * and gravity hint using pango_attr_gravity_new() and
 * pango_attr_gravity_hint_new().
