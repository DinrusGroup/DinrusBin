<p>This tutorial
shows how to change properties of Delphi programs. Properties
contain a lot of parameters of the visual user interface. This also
includes many text messages and the menu ! As demonstration, we use
<a href="http://www.bome.com/midi/keyboard/">Bome's Mouse Keyboard</a> [online].
A bome.com application that allows playing a piano on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>1.
About Delphi programs</strong></p>
<p>Borland's
Delphi is a development tool with which it is made very easy to
create powerful applications. Restorator is created
with Delphi. However, Delphi does not follow the Windows
resource standards. Instead, Delphi creates a predefined resource type called
<i>RCData</i> for each window of the program. This resource contains all
information of that window, e.g. its size, contained controls and
included images.</p>
<p>2<strong>.
Looking at the splash window</strong></p>
<p>Open
MouseKeyboard.exe in examples and have a look at the resource
RCData- TSPLASHFORM1.&nbsp;</p>
<div align="left">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="640">
<tr>
<td><img src="delphi/rstsplash.gif" align="right" hspace="0" ></td>
</tr></table></div>
<p>This is the
window that appears when you start the application or when you
select in the help menu "About". In the Resource Viewer, you can
already see the window definition !</p>
<p>Now save it to
disk (e.g. by dragging and dropping like in the previous
tutorials). The window description is saved as a txt file. All
included images and binary data of Delphi windows are stored in
separate files. In this case, one separate file will be created:
&quot;<a href="delphi/TSplashForm1_Image1_Picture_Data.bmp">TSplashForm1_Image1_Picture_Data.bmp</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Open the text
file with a text editor. You'll see a line where this image is
referenced:</p>
<p><img src="delphi/rsttxt.gif"><br>
You can change any items in the txt file, but you should be
careful, changing too much will result in a non-working application
when saving...</p>
<p>You can also change the image
to create your own keyboard version. Do that like in <a href="TutAbout.html">Tutorial
2</a>. However, don't assign the image, that will
be explained in the next step.</p>
<p><strong>3.
Assigning the modified files</strong></p>
<p>With other
resources, there was just one file to modify and assign. Here you
have 2 of them (the txt and the bmp). As the txt file contains a
reference to the bmp image, you always use the txt file to assign a
Delphi window.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you
should know how to assign resource files, e.g. drag'n'drop
TSplashForm1.txt on the respective resource item. When Restorator
didn't report an error, just save MouseKeyboard.exe as
MouseKeyboard1.exe...and there you go ! It's as simple as that
!</p>
<p>Look also
through the other resources. If you come up with a funky version,
we send you a MouseKeyboard registration.</p>
